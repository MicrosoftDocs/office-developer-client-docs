# xlAutoRemove

 **Applies to**: Excel 2013 | Office 2013 | Visual Studio 
  
Called by Microsoft Excel whenever the user deactivates the XLL during an Excel session by using the Add-In Manager. This function is not called when an Excel session closes, normally or abnormally, with the add-in installed.
  
This function can be used to display a custom dialog box telling the user that the add-in has been deactivated, or to read from or write to the registry, for example.
  
Excel does not require an XLL to implement and export this function. 
  
```cs
int WINAPI xlAutoRemove(void);
```

## Parameters

This function takes no arguments.
  
## Property value/Return value

Your implementation of this function must return 1 (**int**).
  
## Remarks

Use this function if your XLL needs to complete any task when it is removed by the Add-In Manager.
  
## Example

See the files  `\SAMPLES\EXAMPLE\EXAMPLE.C` and  `\SAMPLES\GENERIC\GENERIC.C` for example implementations of this function. The following code is from  `\SAMPLES\EXAMPLE\EXAMPLE.C`.
  
```cs
int WINAPI xlAutoRemove(void)
{
/* Display a dialog box indicating that the XLL was successfully removed */
   Excel12f(xlcAlert, 0, 2,
      TempStr12(L"Thank you for removing Example.XLL!"),
      TempInt12(2));
   return 1;
}
```
