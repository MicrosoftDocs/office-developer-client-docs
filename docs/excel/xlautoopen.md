# xlAutoOpen

 **Applies to**: Excel 2013 | Office 2013 | Visual Studio 
  
Callback function that must be implemented and exported by every valid XLL. The **xlAutoOpen** function is the recommended place from where to register XLL functions and commands, initialize data structures, customize the user interface, and so on. 
  
```cs
int WINAPI xlAutoOpen(void);
```

## Parameters

This function takes no arguments.
  
## Property value/Return value

Your implementation of this function must return 1 (**int**).
  
## Remarks

Microsoft Excel calls **xlAutoOpen** whenever the XLL is activated. The XLL is activated in the following situations: 
  
- At the start of an Excel session if it was active in the last Excel session that ended normally.
    
- If loaded during an Excel session.
    
- An XLL can be loaded in several ways:
    
- By choosing **Open** on the **File** menu (where the version of Excel supports this method of loading XLLs). 
    
- Using the Add-In Manager.
    
- From another XLL that calls [xlfRegister](xlfregister-form-1.md) with the name of this DLL as the only argument. 
    
- From an XLM macro sheet that calls [REGISTER](xlfregister-form-1.md) with the name of this DLL as the only argument. 
    
- If the add-in is deactivated and reactivated during an Excel session, this function is called on reactivation.
