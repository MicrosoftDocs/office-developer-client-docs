```

## Property value/Return value

The return value is one of the following **XLOPER**/ **XLOPER12** data types: **xltypeRef**, **xltypeSRef**, **xltypeNum**, **xltypeStr**, **xltypeErr**, or **xltypeMulti**. Since three of these types point to allocated memory, the return value of **xlfCaller** should always be freed in a call to the [xlFree function](xlfree.md) when it is no longer needed. 
  
For more information about **XLOPERs**/ **XLOPER12s** see [Memory Management in Excel](memory-management-in-excel.md).
  
## Remarks

This function is the only non-worksheet function that can be called from a DLL/XLL worksheet function. Other XLM information functions can only be called from commands or macro-sheet equivalent functions.
  
## Example

 `\SAMPLES\EXAMPLE\EXAMPLE.C`. This function calls a command macro (xlcSelect) and will work correctly only when called from a macro sheet.
  
```cs
short WINAPI CallerExample(void)
{
   XLOPER12 xRes;
   Excel12(xlfCaller, &xRes, 0);
   Excel12(xlcSelect, 0, 1, (LPXLOPER12)&xRes);
   Excel12(xlFree, 0, 1, (LPXLOPER12)&xRes);
   return 1;
}
```
