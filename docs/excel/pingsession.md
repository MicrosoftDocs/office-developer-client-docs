# PingSession

**Applies to**: Excel 2013 | Office 2013 | Visual Studio 
  
Checks whether a session is valid. This function is typically called when Excel needs to determine if a previously returned session ID is still active and can be used.

int PingSession(int SessionId)
```

## Parameters

> The ID of the session to ping. This value must match an ID returned by a previous call to [OpenSession](opensession.md).
    
## Return value

**xlHpcRetSuccess** if the  _SessionId_ argument is valid; otherwise **xlHpcRetInvalidSessionId**.
