# Project conceptual and how-to articles

Find links to information in this section about the major parts of the Project 2013 platform, getting started with CSOM development by using JavaScript and the .NET Framework, task pane add-ins in Project Professional 2013, the Project Server Interface, and the OData reporting service.
  
Project Server 2013 is based on the Project Server Interface (PSI) web service framework introduced in Office Project Server 2007. The Project Server 2013 platform is built with the .NET Framework 4. Project Web App requires SharePoint Server 2013 as a base for the functionality of new features, such as the client-side object model (CSOM) for access to Project Server in the cloud, version 4 of the Windows Workflow Foundation (WF4), and the OData service for the reporting database tables. Project Professional 2013 can use the new task pane Office Add-ins.
