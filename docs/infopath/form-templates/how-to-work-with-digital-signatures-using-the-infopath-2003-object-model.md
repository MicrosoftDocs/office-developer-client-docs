# Work with Digital Signatures Using the InfoPath 2003 Object Model

The InfoPath 2003-compatible object model provides features for working with digital signatures programmatically.
  
## Digital Signature Features

The digital signatures features available in InfoPath enable you to: 
  
- Enable signatures for the entire form, or for specific sets of data in the form that can be signed separately.
    
- Specify, for each set of data that can be signed, whether a single signature or multiple signatures are allowed and what their relationship will be. For example, you can specify whether they are parallel co-signatures or whether each new signature countersigns all the earlier signatures.
    
- Specify a message to be shown to form users as they sign the form.
    
- Insert and see a signature in the document. 
    
- View verifiable non-repudiation information that has been added to each signature for increased security. This additional information, which includes a view of the form as it was presented to each signer, is part of the signature and cannot be removed without invalidating the signature. At any time, you can recall this data by clicking on the signature in the form to display the **Verify Digital Signature** dialog box. 
    
- Take advantage of an object model for working with digital signatures. Add custom information to the signature block in fully trusted forms through the digital signature object model. 
    
## Overview of the Digital Signatures Object Model

### Events

The object model for digital signatures provides the following event.
  
|**Name**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|[OnSign](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Microsoft.Office.Interop.InfoPath.SemiTrust._XDocumentEventSink2_Event.OnSign.aspx) <br/> |Occurs after a set of signable data has been selected to sign.  <br/> You can use this event to manipulate the data stored within the digital signature. For example, you can add data from a trusted timestamp server, or add a server-side countersignature of the transaction. You can also use this event to block signing if the current user is not a member of a particular group.  <br/> |
   
The **OnSign** event returns a reference to the [SignEventObject](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Microsoft.Office.Interop.InfoPath.SemiTrust.SignEventObject.aspx) object, which provides the following properties. 
  
|**Name**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|[ReturnStatus](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Microsoft.Office.Interop.InfoPath.SignEvent.ReturnStatus.aspx) <br/> |Gets or sets a **Boolean** value indicating the return status of the **OnSign** event.  <br/> |
|[SignedDataBlock](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Microsoft.Office.Interop.InfoPath.SignEvent.SignedDataBlock.aspx) <br/> |Gets the signed data block that triggered the **OnSign** event.  <br/> |
|[XDocument](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Microsoft.Office.Interop.InfoPath.SemiTrust.SignEvent.XDocument.aspx) <br/> |Gets a reference to the **XDocument** object associated with the **OnSign** event.  <br/> |
   
### Collections and Objects

The object model for digital signatures provides the following collections.
  
|**Name**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|[SignedDataBlocksCollection](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Microsoft.Office.Interop.InfoPath.SemiTrust.SignedDataBlocksCollection.aspx) <br/> |The collection of the [SignedDataBlockObject](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Microsoft.Office.Interop.InfoPath.SemiTrust.SignedDataBlockObject.aspx) objects in the form template as defined in the form definition file (.xsf).  <br/> The **SignedDataBlocksCollection** collection implements properties that can be used to access the **SignedDataBlockObjects** objects associated with a form. The **SignedDataBlocks** collection is accessible through the [SignedDataBlocks](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Microsoft.Office.Interop.InfoPath.SemiTrust._XDocument2.SignedDataBlocks.aspx) property of the [XDocument](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Microsoft.Office.Interop.InfoPath.SemiTrust.XDocument.aspx) object.  <br/> |
|[SignaturesCollection](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Microsoft.Office.Interop.InfoPath.SemiTrust.SignaturesCollection.aspx) <br/> |Contains a collection of [SignatureObject](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Microsoft.Office.Interop.InfoPath.SemiTrust.SignatureObject.aspx) objects for each **SignedDataBlockObject** in the form.  <br/> The **SignaturesCollection** collection implements properties and a method that can be used to access a form's associated **SignatureObject** objects and to create a signature. It is accessible through the **SignedDataBlockObject** object.  <br/> When you use the [Create](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Microsoft.Office.Interop.InfoPath.SemiTrust.Signatures.Create.aspx) method of the **SignaturesCollection** collection, keep in mind that the signature is not written until the [Sign](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Microsoft.Office.Interop.InfoPath.SemiTrust.Signature.Sign.aspx) method is called on the **SignatureObject** object. These methods can be called only from the **OnSign** event handler of a fully trusted form template.  <br/> |
   
The object model for digital signatures provides the following objects.
  
|**Name**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|[SignedDataBlockObject](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Microsoft.Office.Interop.InfoPath.SemiTrust.SignedDataBlockObject.aspx) <br/> |Represents a set of signable data in a form. The **SignedDataBlock** object provides a number of properties and one method that can be used to programmatically interact with a set of signable data.  <br/> |
|[SignatureObject](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Microsoft.Office.Interop.InfoPath.SemiTrust.SignatureObject.aspx) <br/> |Represents a digital signature that has been added to a form or set of signable data in a form. The **SignatureObject** collection implements properties that can be used to retrieve information about the digital signature, and the [Sign](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Microsoft.Office.Interop.InfoPath.SemiTrust.Signature.Sign.aspx) method for writing the XML digital signature block and computing its cryptographic hash value.  <br/> |
|[CertificateObject](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Microsoft.Office.Interop.InfoPath.SemiTrust.CertificateObject.aspx) <br/> |Represents the X.509 digital certificate that has been used to create the signature.  <br/> |
   
## Working with Digital Signatures Programmatically

The InfoPath 2003-compatible object model provides members for interacting with digital signatures programmatically. In particular, fully-trusted forms can add custom information to the signature block before it is committed, according to the following timeline:
  
1. User chooses to add a digital signature to a form.
    
2. The first panel of the **Digital Signature Wizard** is displayed. 
    
3. The **OnSign** event for the selected data represented by the **SignedDataBlockObject** object is raised, and the **Sign** method of **SignedDataBlockObject** and the **Create** method of the **SignaturesCollection** collection are executed. 
    
4. Any optional custom actions are executed.
    
5. The **Sign** method of the **SignatureObject** is executed. 
    
6. Second and third panes of the wizard are displayed for selecting a certificate to sign with and to enter comments.
    
7. The non-repudiation information is displayed (which can be viewed later with the **Verify Digital Signature** dialog box). 
    
8. When the **Sign** button is clicked, the signature is added to collection of signatures for the form. 
    
The following example invokes the **Sign** dialog box and countersigns the signature with a timestamp value retrieved from a trusted timestamp service. 
  
```cs
[InfoPathEventHandler(EventType=InfoPathEventType.OnSign)]
public void OnSign(SignEvent e)
{
    Signature signature = e.SignedDataBlock.Signatures.Create();
    // Invoke the Sign dialog box to sign the data block.
    signature.Sign();
    // Countersign the signature with a trusted timestamp
    // Get the XML node storing the signature block
    IXMLDOMNode oNodeSig = signature.SignatureBlockXmlNode;
    IXMLDOMNode oNodeSigValue = oNodeSig.selectSingleNode(".//*[local-name(.)='signatureValue']");
    // Get timestamp from a trusted timestamp service (fictitious).
    MyTrustedTimeStampService s = new MyTrustedTimeStampService();
    string strVerifiedTimeStamp = s.AddTimeStamp(oNodeSigValue.text);
    
    //Add the value returned from the timestamp service to the 
    //unsigned part of the signature block
    IXMLDOMNode oNodeObj = oNodeSig.selectSingleNode(".//*[local-name(.)='Object']");
    IXMLDOMNode oNode = oNodeObj.cloneNode(false);
    oNode.text = strVerifiedTimeStamp;
    oNodeObj.parentNode.appendChild(oNode);
    e.ReturnStatus = true;
}
```
