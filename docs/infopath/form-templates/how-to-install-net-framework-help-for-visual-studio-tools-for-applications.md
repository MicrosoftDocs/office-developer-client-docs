# Install local .NET Framework Help for Visual Studio Tools for Applications

When the computer on which you are running Microsoft InfoPath and Visual Studio 2012 is connected to the Internet, the Visual Studio 2012 help viewer can access .NET Framework documentation and the Visual Basic and Visual C# language references from online sources. However, when the computer you are working with is not connected to the Internet, you cannot access these sources of documentation until you download and install a local copy of .NET Framework 2.0 SDK documentation and perform the steps required to integrate that documentation with the Visual Studio 2012 development environment.
  
To view a help topic that describes how to do this, open the help **Contents** pane, expand **Visual Studio for Applications**, expand **Getting Started with the Integrated Development Environment**, and then click **Integrate the .NET Framework SDK Documentation with the Integrated Development Environment**.
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are running under Windows Vista with user account control, you must start InfoPath as an administrator before performing the procedure referenced above. To do that, navigate to C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office14, right-click INFOPATH.EXE, and then click **Run as administrator**. If you are not running InfoPath as an administrator, you will be unable to complete the procedure.
