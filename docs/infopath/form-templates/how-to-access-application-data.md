# Access Application Data

The InfoPath managed code object model provides objects and collections that can be used to gain access to information about the InfoPath application, including information related to a form's underlying XML document and the form definition (.xsf) file. This data is accessed through the top-level object in the InfoPath object model hierarchy, which is instantiated by using the [Application](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Microsoft.Office.InfoPath.Application.aspx) class. 
  
In an InfoPath managed code form template project created using Visual Studio 2012, you can use the **this** (C#) or **Me** (Visual Basic) keyword to access an instance of the [Application](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Microsoft.Office.InfoPath.Application.aspx) class that represents the current InfoPath application, which can then be used to access the properties and methods of the [Application](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Microsoft.Office.InfoPath.Application.aspx) class. 
  
## Example

### Displaying the Application Name, Version, and Language ID

In the following example, the [Name](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Microsoft.Office.InfoPath.Application.Name.aspx) and [Version](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Microsoft.Office.InfoPath.Application.Version.aspx) properties of the [Application](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Microsoft.Office.InfoPath.Application.aspx) class are used to return the name and version number of the running instance of InfoPath. The [LanguageSettings](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Microsoft.Office.InfoPath.Application.LanguageSettings.aspx) property is then used to return a **LanguageSettings** object, which in turn is used to return the LCID (a four-digit number) for the language that is currently being used for the InfoPath user interface language. Finally, all of this information is displayed in a message box. 
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> For the **LanguageSettings** property to work, you must establish a reference to the Microsoft Office 14.0 Object Library from the **COM** tab of the **Add Reference** dialog box in Visual Studio 2012. This will establish a reference to the **Microsoft.Office.Core** namespace, which contains the **LanguageSettings** class. Additionally, the form must be running as Full Trust. 
  
This example requires a **using** or **Imports** directive for the **Microsoft.Office.Core** namespace in the declarations section of the form code module. 
  
```cs
string appName = this.Application.Name;
string appVersion = this.Application.Version;
LanguageSettings langSettings = 
   (LanguageSettings)this.Application.LanguageSettings;
int langID = 
   langSettings.get_LanguageID(MsoAppLanaguageID.msoLanguageIDUI);
MessageBox.Show(
   "Name: " + appName + System.Environment.NewLine +
   "Version: " + appVersion + System.Environment.NewLine +
   "Language ID: " + langID);
```

```VB.net
Dim appName As String appName = Me.Application.Name
Dim appVersion As String = Me.Application.Version
Dim langSettings As LanguageSettings = _
   DirectCast(Me.Application.LanguageSettings, LanguageSettings)
Dim langID As Integer = _
   langSettings.LanguageID(MsoAppLanaguageID.msoLanguageIDUI)
MessageBox.Show( _
   "Name: " + appName + System.Environment.NewLine + _
   "Version: " + appVersion + System.Environment.NewLine + _
   "Language ID: " + langID)
```
