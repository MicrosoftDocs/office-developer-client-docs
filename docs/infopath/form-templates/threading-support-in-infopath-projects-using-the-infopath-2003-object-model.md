# Threading Support in InfoPath Projects Using the InfoPath 2003 Object Model

The COM objects accessed through the Microsoft.Office.Interop.InfoPath.dll, Microsoft.Office.Interop.InfoPath.SemiTrust.dll, and Microsoft.Office.Interop.InfoPath.Xml.dll interop assemblies installed by Microsoft InfoPath do not support calls made on multiple threads. This includes the interfaces for Microsoft XML Core Services (MSXML) objects that are wrapped by the **Microsoft.Office.Interop.InfoPath.SemiTrust** namespace (most of which have names that are prefixed with IXMLDOM) and all of the interfaces exposed by the [Microsoft.Office.Interop.InfoPath.Xml](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.office.interop.infopath.xml)  namespace, none of which are thread-safe. 
  
All calls made to these COM objects must be issued on a single thread. Managed code in an InfoPath project can create other threads to perform background work, but code running on threads other than the main thread cannot call into the InfoPath object models.
  
If your InfoPath managed code project uses multiple threads, you must be careful about sharing objects between threads. No references to the XML Document Object Model (DOM) or references to InfoPath objects should be shared between threads. 
  
## Making Asynchronous Calls to the InfoPath Object Model

For situations where it is necessary to call into a process such as a timer running on a separate thread, it is possible to work around the fact that the InfoPath object model does not support such calls. 
  
The following example creates a **System.Timers.Timer** instance in the _Startup method of the form and hooks up an asynchronous callback to the timer. In addition, an invisible instance of the window form ( **System.Windows.Forms.Form**) is created. When the timer elapsed callback function executes once per second, it calls into the Win32 **PostMessage** function to post a message to the invisible window. The invisible window has a **WndProc** function that processes the message it receives from the timer callback function, and updates the XML document object model (DOM) of the form. This form must be installed as a fully trusted form to run. For information on debugging a fully trusted form template, see [Preview and Debug Form Templates that Require Full Trust](how-to-preview-and-debug-form-templates-that-require-full-trust.md). For information on deploying a fully trusted form template, see [Deploy InfoPath Form Templates with Code](how-to-deploy-infopath-form-templates-with-code.md).
