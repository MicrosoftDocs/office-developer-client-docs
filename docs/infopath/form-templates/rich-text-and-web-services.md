# Rich Text and Web Services

Microsoft InfoPath supports binding a **Rich Text Box** control in a form to an XML element that is received from a Web service, and submitting data from a rich text box control to an XML element through a Web service. The element must adhere to the Extensible HyperText Markup Language (XHTML) format. For example, the schema for an element named  `MyRichTextElement` that contains rich text would have the following XML schema definition: 
  
```XML
<xsd:element name="MyRichTextElement"> 
    <xsd:complexType mixed="true"> 
        <xsd:sequence> 
            <xsd:any namespace="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" processContents="lax" 
                minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/> 
        </xsd:sequence> 
    </xsd:complexType> 
</xsd:element>
```

Before a **Rich Text Box** control can be bound with the XHTML element, the element should be wrapped with a wrapper node; this wrapper node can belong to any arbitrary namespace. The wrapper node can look like this: 
  
```
<xhtmlNode xmlns="http:// someNamespace"> 
    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Your rich text here</div> 
</xhtmlNode>
```

This topic outlines the process of creating a Web service that can send and receive XHTML, and how to use InfoPath to bind to the Web service parameters. This topic does not provide detailed instructions on how to create such a Web service. It is assumed that you already have some familiarity with working with Web services.
  
## How to Design a Web Service to Receive and Send XHTML

The example Web service stores the XHTML data that it sends and receives in an XML file on the server. This file that is named out.xml, acts as a data source that stores the XHTML data. There are two Web methods that will be exposed to allow a client application to interface with the XHTML data source:  `getXhtml` and  `setXhtml`. The  `getXhtml` Web Service method returns an **XmlNode** that contains the XHTML that can be bound to an InfoPath rich text box control. The  `setXhtml` Web Service method accepts an **XmlNode** as the data to store in the out.xml file. 
  
> [!NOTE]
> These Web methods require **using** statements that reference the **System.IO** and **System.Xml** namespaces. 
  
The  `getXhtml` Web Service method attempts to load the XML data to be returned from the out.xml file in the Data folder on drive C. If it fails, because the file is not found, or does not contain valid XML, the method will return an empty **DIV** HTML element that references the XHTML namespace. 
  
```cs
[WebMethod]
public XmlNode getXhtml()  
{  
            // This is the returned XmlDocument upon Query from InfoPath 
            XmlDocument document = new XmlDocument(); 
 
            // Create a wrapping node with the name of the rich text field. 
            // The "http://someNameSpace" can be any arbitrary namespace 
            XmlNode richNode = document.CreateNode 
                        (XmlNodeType.Element, "MyRichTextElement", "http://someNameSpace"); 
 
            // Temporary XmlDocument 
            XmlDocument tempDocument = new XmlDocument(); 
            try 
            { 
                // Read the saved rich text data from the local machine 
                tempDocument.Load(@"c:\Data\out.xml"); 
            } 
            catch (XmlException) 
            { 
                // If the file does not exist or content is not valid XML 
                tempDocument.LoadXml("<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"></div>"); 
            } 
 
            // Add the file content to the xml 
            richNode.AppendChild 
                        (document.ImportNode(tempDocument.DocumentElement, true)); 
 
            return richNode; 
}  

```

The  `setXhtml` Web Service method accepts XHTML from a **Rich Text Box** control on an InfoPath form. Because Web services do not support a node list, when a rich text field that contains multiple lines is sent to a Web service, the Web service only accepts the first line and ignores the rest. 
  
The sample  `setXhtml` method assumes that it will receive a top-level XML node, which in most cases will be wrapped in a **DIV** element. If the XML received does not contain a wrapping element, for example when text within the **Rich Text Box** control has no formatting, this method will detect this by checking whether the **NodeType** property indicates that the XML passed in is a text node. If the XML is a text node, the method creates a **DIV** element and copies the text node contents to the **DIV** so that the **DIV** contains a text node child with the text that was sent to the Web service. The XML received by this method is written to the out.xml file in the Data folder on the drive C. 
  
> [!NOTE]
> The sample  `setXhtml` method was written to accept XHTML data of any size. In actual practice, you should always check to see how much data is being submitted and set an upper limit for how much data that can be submitted. 
  
```cs
[WebMethod]  
public void setXhtml(XmlNode xn)  
{  
            XmlDocument document = new XmlDocument(); 
 
            if (xn == null) 
            { 
                // If nothing was submitted or the rich text field is empty, 
                // create a DIV that references the XHTML namespace 
                XmlElement div = document.CreateElement("div", "http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"); 
                // Copy the node to our own XmlDocument 
                document.AppendChild(div); 
            } 
            if (xn.NodeType == XmlNodeType.Text) 
            { 
                // If plain text is passed in, wrap it in a DIV 
                // that references the XHTML namespace 
                XmlElement div = document.CreateElement("div", "http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"); 
                // Copy the text to the DIV. 
                div.AppendChild(document.ImportNode(xn, true)); 
                // Copy the node to our own XmlDocument 
                document.AppendChild(div); 
            } 
            else 
            { 
                // Copy the node to our own XmlDocument 
                document.AppendChild(document.ImportNode(xn, true)); 
            } 
 
            // Save the file to the local machine 
            document.Save(@"c:\Data\out.xml"); 
}  

```

## How to Create an InfoPath Form That Exchanges Data with the Sample Web Service

Perform the following steps to create a form to test the sample Web service.
  
### To create a form that connects to the sample Web service

1. Open the InfoPath form designer.
    
2. On the **New** tab, double-click **Web Service** under **Advanced Form Templates**.
    
3. In the **Data Connection Wizard** dialog box, select **Receive data**, and then click **Next**.
    
4. Type the address of the Web service that contains the sample Web service methods, and then click **Next**. 
    
5. For the receive method, select **getXhtml** as the operation, and then click **Next**.
    
6. The **getXHTML** Web service method takes no parameters, so click **Next**.
    
7. Click **Finish**.
    
8. On the **Data** tab, in the **Submit Actions** group click **To Other Locations**, and then click **Web Service** to use the same Web service to the submit data. 
    
9. Type the address of the Web service that contains the sample Web service methods, and then click **Next**.
    
10. For the submit method, select **setXhtml** as the operation, and then click **Next**.
    
11. Click **Modify**, expand the **dataFields** folder, expand the **s0:getXhtmlResponse** folder, expand the **getXhtmlResult** folder, select the **MyRichTextElement** element, and then click **Next**.
    
12. Click **Finish**.
    
13. In the **Fields** task pane, expand the **dataFields** folder. 
    
14. Expand the **s0:getXhtmlResponse** and **getXhtmlResult** folders, and then drag the **MyRichTextElement** element onto the form. InfoPath will recognize that the **MyRichTextElement** element is an XHTML element and will use a rich text box control to bind to it. 
    
15. Save or publish the form.
    
To test the form, open the form, enter some rich text content such as pictures, tables, and formatted text. Click **Submit** on the ribbon to store the rich text content in the out.xml file on the server. Click **Query** on the **View** tab, and then click the **Run Query** button on the form. The **Rich Text Box** control should display the XHTML content from the out.xml file. If the rich text field contains multiple lines, the Web service will only accept the first line and ignore the rest.
