# Work with Offline Solutions

The InfoPath object model provides the [MachineOnlineState](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Microsoft.Office.InfoPath.Application.MachineOnlineState.aspx) property of the [Application](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Microsoft.Office.InfoPath.Application.aspx) class that enables your form code to check whether the user's computer is connected to the network. By checking the value of **MachineOnlineState** property, your form code can perform different actions depending on the state of the connection. 
  
## Using the MachineOnlineState Property

The following example shows how you can add logic to your form code that determines how to submit a form based on whether the user's computer is online or offline.
  
This example assumes that you have created a form for submitting a sales report that contains a field named period that specifies the month and year covered in the report. It also assumes that you have already defined a data connection and the logic for submitting the report when the user is online. 
  
### Add a data connection that submits the form as an attachment to an e-mail message

1. Create an InfoPath form template using the **Blank (InfoPath Editor)** template. 
    
2. In InfoPath design mode, click **Data Connections** on the **Data** tab. 
    
3. In the **Data Connections** dialog box, click **Add**.
    
4. In the **Data Connection Wizard**, click **Submit data**, and then click **Next**.
    
5. On the next page of the wizard, click **As an e-mail message**, and then click **Next**.
    
6. On the next page of the wizard, type your e-mail address in the **To** box. 
    
7. In the **Subject** box, do the following to combine the sales period with the text Sales Report: 
    
1. Click the **Formula** button next to the **Subject** box. 
    
2. In the **Insert Formula** dialog box, click **Insert Function**.
    
3. In the **Insert Function** dialog box, click **Text** in the **Categories** list, and then double-click **concat** in the **Functions** list. 
    
4. Replace the first instance of **double click to insert field** with the following (include the single quotes): 'Sales Report: ' 
    
5. Double-click the second instance of **double click to insert field**.
    
6. In the **Select a Field or Group** dialog box, select the period field. 
    
7. Delete the final instance of **double click to insert field**, and then click **OK**.
    
8. In the wizard, click **Next**.
    
9. On the next page of the wizard, click the **Formula** button next to the **Attachment Name** box, and then repeat the steps above to create the formula concat("Sales Report - ", period), and then click **Next**.
    
10. On the last page of the wizard, type E-mail Submit in the **Enter a name for this data connection** box, and then click **Finish**.
    
### Add logic for submitting the form depending on the connected state of a user's computer

1. In InfoPath design mode, click **Submit Options** on the **Data** tab. 
    
2. In the **Submit Options** dialog box, click **Allow users to submit this form**, select **Perform custom action using Code**, click **Edit Code**.
    
3. Add the following two functions below the [Submit](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Microsoft.Office.InfoPath.FormEvents.Submit.aspx) event handler: 
    
  ```cs
  public void OnlineSubmit(SubmitEventArgs e)
  {
     // Logic for submitting online goes here.
  }
  public void OfflineSubmit(SubmitEventArgs e)
  {
     // Access and submit to the e-mail connection.
     DataConnectionCollection myDataConnections =
        this.DataConnections;
     EmailSubmitConnection submitConnection =
        (EmailSubmitConnection)myDataConnections["E-mail Submit"];
     submitConnection.Execute();
     // Notify the user that the form was submitted offline.
     System.Text.StringBuilder myMessage = 
        new System.Text.StringBuilder();
     myMessage.Append("You submitted your Sales Report offline. ");
     myMessage.Append("Your Sales Report is in your outbox ");
     myMessage.Append("and will be submitted when you connect to ");
     myMessage.Append("the network.");
      MessageBox.Show(myMessage.ToString());
     // The submission was successful.
     e.CancelableArgs.Cancel = false;
  }
  ```

  ```vb
  Public Sub OnlineSubmit(ByVal e As SubmitEventArgs)
     ' Logic for submitting online goes here.
  End Sub
  Public Sub OfflineSubmit(ByVal e As SubmitEventArgs)
     ' Access and submit to the e-mail connection.
     Dim myDataConnections As DataConnectionCollection = _
        Me.DataConnections
     Dim submitConnection As EmailSubmitConnection = _
        DirectCast(myDataConnections("E-mail Submit"), _
        EmailSubmitConnection)
     submitConnection.Execute
     ' Notify the user that the form was submitted offline.
     Dim myMessage As System.Text.StringBuilder = _
        New System.Text.StringBuilder()
     myMessage.Append("You submitted your Sales Report offline. ")
     myMessage.Append("Your Sales Report is in your outbox ")
     myMessage.Append("and will be submitted when you connect to ")
     myMessage.Append("the network.")
      MessageBox.Show(myMessage.ToString())
     ' The submission was successful.
     e.CancelableArgs.Cancel = False
  End Sub
  ```

4. Add the following **if** statement to the [Submit](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Microsoft.Office.InfoPath.FormEvents.Submit.aspx) event handler function. 
    
  ```cs
  // Check the computer's connection state.
  if (this.Application.MachineOnlineState == MachineState.Online)
  {
     OnlineSubmit(e);
  }
  else
  {
     OfflineSubmit(e);
  }
  ```

  ```vb
  ' Check the computer's connection state.
  If (Me.Application.MachineOnlineState = MachineState.Online) Then
     OnlineSubmit(e)
  Else
  {
     OfflineSubmit(e)
  End If
  ```

### Test the code

1. On the **Debug** menu, click **Start Debugging**.
    
2. Fill out the form.
    
3. Start Microsoft Internet Explorer.
    
4. In Internet Explorer, click **Work offline** on the **File** menu. 
    
5. In InfoPath, click **Submit**. You should see a message that the form will be submitted as an e-mail message.
    
6. Click **Send**. You should see a message stating that the form has been submitted offline and will be submitted when you connect to the network.
