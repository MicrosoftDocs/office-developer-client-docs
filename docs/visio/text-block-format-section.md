# Text Block Format Section

Contains cells that control the alignment, margins, and default tab stop position of text in a shape's text block.
  
## Remarks

You can also set these text attributes by using the **Text** dialog box (on the **Home** tab, click the dialog box launcher in the **Font** group).
