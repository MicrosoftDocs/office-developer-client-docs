# EndTrigger Cell (Glue Info Section)

Contains a trigger formula generated by the application that determines whether to move the endpoint of a 1-D shape to maintain its connection to another shape.
  
## Remarks

When you glue a 1-D shape to another shape using dynamic glue, Visio generates a formula that refers to the EventXFMod cell of the other shape. When that shape is changed, Visio recalculates any formula that refers to its EventXFMod cell, including the formula in the EndTrigger cell. Other formulas of the 1-D shape refer to the EndTrigger cell and move the endpoint of the 1-D shape or alter the shape as needed.
  
To get a reference to the EndTrigger cell by name from another formula, or from a program using the **CellsU** property, use: 
  
|||
|:-----|:-----|
| Cell name:  <br/> | EndTrigger  <br/> |
   
To get a reference to the EndTrigger cell by index from a program, use the **CellsSRC** property with the following arguments: 
  
|||
|:-----|:-----|
| Section index:  <br/> |**visSectionObject** <br/> |
| Row index:  <br/> |**visRowMisc** <br/> |
| Cell index:  <br/> |**visEndTrigger** <br/> |
