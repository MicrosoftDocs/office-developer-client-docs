# BITOR Function

Returns a 16-bit binary number in which each bit is set to 1 if the corresponding bit in either  *binary number1*  or  *binary number2*  is 1. The bit is set to 0 only if the corresponding bit is 0 in both  *binary number1*  and  *binary number2*  . 
  
## Syntax

BITOR(** *binary number1* **, ** *binary number2* ** ) 
  
### Parameters

|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _binary number1_ <br/> |Required  <br/> |**Numeric** <br/> |The first 16-bit binary number.  <br/> |
| _binary number2_ <br/> |Required  <br/> |**Numeric** <br/> |The second 16-bit binary number.  <br/> |
   
### Return value

16-bit Binary
  
## Example

BITOR(12,6)
  
Returns 14. The 12 = 0...01100. The 6 = 0...00110. Therefore, BITOR(12,6) = 0...01110.
