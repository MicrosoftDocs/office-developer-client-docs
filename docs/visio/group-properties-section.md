# Group Properties Section

Contains cells for a group that control how you add shapes to a group, move members of a group, and select groups. 
  
## Remarks

You can also set these values on the **Behavior** tab in the **Behavior** dialog box (click **Behavior** in the **Shape Design** group on the [Developer](run-in-developer-mode-display-the-developer-tab.md) tab).
