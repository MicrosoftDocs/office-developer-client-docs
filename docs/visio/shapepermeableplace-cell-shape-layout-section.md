# ShapePermeablePlace Cell (Shape Layout Section)

Determines whether placeable shapes can be placed on top of a shape when laying out shapes in the **Configure Layout** dialog box (on the **Design** tab, in the **Layout** group, click **Re-Layout Page**, and then click **More Layout Options**).
  
|**Value**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|TRUE  <br/> |Enable shapes to be placed on top of a shape. |
|FALSE  <br/> |Do not enable shapes to be placed on top of a shape. |
   
## Remarks

You can also set the value of this cell on the **Placement** tab in the **Behavior** dialog box (with a shape selected, on the [Developer](run-in-developer-mode-display-the-developer-tab.md) tab, in the **Shape Design** group, click **Behavior**, and then click the **Placement** tab). 
  
In versions earlier than Visio 2000, you set this behavior using the ObjInteract cell in the Miscellaneous section.
