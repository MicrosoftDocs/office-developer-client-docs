# QUEUEMARKEREVENT Function

Causes the application to fire a marker event to your add-on, Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) code, or COM add-in. 
  
## Syntax

QUEUEMARKEREVENT (** *event_string* ** ) 
  
### Parameters

|**Name**|**Required/Optional**|**Data Type**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| _event_string_ <br/> |Required  <br/> |**String** <br/> | The string to pass to your event handler.  <br/> |
   
## Remarks

The QUEUEMARKEREVENT function provides developers with a way to notify their code from a ShapeSheet cell, and pass solution-specific information. When the cell containing the formula with the QUEUEMARKEREVENT function is evaluated, the application fires a marker event and passes  _event_string_ to all event handlers that are listening to the **MarkerEvent** event. 
  
For more information about marker events, see the **QueueMarkerEvent** method and **MarkerEvent** event topics in the Microsoft Visio Automation Reference. 
  
## Example

QUEUEMARKEREVENT ("MyCustomNotification") 
  
Causes the application to fire a marker event, and passes the string "MyCustomNotification" to event handlers that are listening to the **MarkerEvent** event.
