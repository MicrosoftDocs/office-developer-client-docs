# InfiniteLine Row (Geometry Section)

Contains the  *x*  - and  *y*  -coordinates of two points on an infinite line. 
  
An InfiniteLine row contains the following cells.
  
|**Cell**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|[X](x-cell-geometry-section.md) <br/> |An  *x*  -coordinate of a point on the infinite line; paired with  *y*  -coordinate represented by the Y cell.  <br/> |
|[Y](y-cell-geometry-section.md) <br/> |A  *y*  -coordinate of a point on the infinite line; paired with  *x*  -coordinate represented by the X cell.  <br/> |
|[A](a-cell-geometry-section.md) <br/> |An  *x*  -coordinate of a point on the infinite line; paired with  *y*  -coordinate represented by the B cell.  <br/> |
|[B](b-cell-geometry-section.md) <br/> |A  *y*  -coordinate of a point on an infinite line; paired with  *x*  -coordinate represented by the A cell.  <br/> |
   
## Remarks

A geometry section that contains an Ellipse or InfiniteLine row should not contain any other rows.
