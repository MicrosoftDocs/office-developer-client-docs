# User-defined Cells Section

A work area for entering formulas in user-specific cells that can be referred to by other cells and add-on tools.
  
## Remarks

Like the [Scratch](scratch-section.md) section, the **User-defined Cells** section can be used by your solution in many different ways. The advantage of the **User-defined Cells** section is that cells can be named; cells in the **Scratch** section cannot be named. 
  
If your solution has a well-defined purpose it is suggested that you use cells in the **User-defined Cells** section for clarity because User cells can be named. The **Scratch** section is typically used to isolate repeated complex calculations. 
  
To add this section, use the **Insert Section** dialog box (right-click in the ShapeSheet window and click **Insert Section**).
