# Character Section

Shows the formatting attributes for the shape's text, such as font, color, text style, case, position relative to the baseline, and point size.
  
## Remarks

Each character style in a shape has a corresponding row in the **Character** section as viewed in the ShapeSheet window. The name of the row represents the number of characters the character style applies to. 
  
You can set text formats in the **Text** dialog box (click the dialog box launcher in the **Font** group on the **Home** tab), by applying a text style, or by making an entry in a **Character** section cell.
