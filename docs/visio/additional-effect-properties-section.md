# Additional Effect Properties Section

Shows the additional effects applied to the shape, including reflection, glow, and soft edges effects. This section also included the values for a Sketch effect.
  
## Remarks

You can set the reflection, glow, and soft edges effects in the **Format Shape** dialog box (**Home** > **Shape Styles** > **Effects**). A Sketch effect can be applied to a shape by using one of the sketch themes (**Design** > **Themes** > **Effects**) or by making changes to values in the corresponding ShapeSheet cells.
