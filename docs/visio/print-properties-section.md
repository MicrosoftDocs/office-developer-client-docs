# Print Properties Section

Contains the cells that control how the drawing page is formatted (appears) on the printer page. 
  
## Remarks

Use the **Print Properties** section to control printing at the page level. These settings are per page and are independent of the drawing page settings, for example, a drawing page that uses landscape orientation can be printed using portrait orientation. Also, documents can be printed using a combination of orientations. 
  
The settings in the **Print Properties** section correspond to the values set on the **Print Setup** tab in the **Page Setup** dialog box (on the **Design** tab, click the dialog box launcher in the **Page Setup** group). See the **Page Properties** section for settings that apply to the drawing page.
