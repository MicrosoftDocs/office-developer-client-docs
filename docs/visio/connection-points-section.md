# Connection Points Section

Contains a row and cells for each connection point defined for the shape.
  
## Remarks

You can define connection points in the **Connection Points** section in the ShapeSheet window or by clicking the **Connection Point** tool on the **Home** tab. 
  
If your shape has no **Connection Points** section you can insert a **Connection Points** section in the ShapeSheet window. Right-click in the ShapeSheet window, click **Insert Section**, and then click **Connection points**. To add connection points to an existing **Connection Points** section, right-click a row and click **Insert Row** on the shortcut menu. 
  
You can change the row type of a connection point in this section to display additional cells that you can use for scratch calculations. To do this, right-click the row, and then click **Change Row Type** on the shortcut menu.
