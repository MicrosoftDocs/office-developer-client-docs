# Page Layout Section

Contains cells that control the page settings for shapes and connectors, such as the spacing between all shapes on the page, spacing between all connectors on the page, and routing style for all connectors on the page.
  
## Remarks

To override the page defaults for a specific shape, use the cells in the **Shape Layout** section. 
  
You can also set the values of the cells in this section on the **Layout and Routing** tab in the **Page Setup** dialog box (on the **Design** tab, click the dialog box launcher in the **Page Setup** group).
