# Foreign Image Info Section

Contains the width and height of an object from another program used in a Microsoft Visio drawing and appears in the ShapeSheet window only for such objects. It also indicates the distance the object's image is offset within its borders.
  
## Remarks

In versions of Visio products earlier than version 2000, this section was named **Image Info**.
