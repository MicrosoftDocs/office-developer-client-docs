## Remarks

The index of a container is calculated based on the z-order of containers from front to back.
  
 *Categories*  are user-defined strings that you can use to categorize shapes. You can define categories in the User.msvShapeCategories cell in the ShapeSheet for a shape. You can define multiple categories for a shape by separating the categories with semi-colons. 
  
If the shape is not a member of a container, or if there is no container that matches both the specified index number and the category, CONTAINERSHEETREF returns #REF!.
  
## Example

CONTAINERSHEETREF(1)!Height 
  
Returns the value in the Height cell of the container that is most forward on the page to which the shape belongs.
