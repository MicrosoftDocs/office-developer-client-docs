# Text Fields Section

Displays functions and formulas inserted in the shape's text by using the **Field** dialog box. 
  
## Remarks

The only way to add this section is to insert a field into a shape by using the **Field** dialog box (**Insert** tab). 
  
Each text field in a text block has a corresponding row in the ShapeSheet window. The name of the row represents the number of characters the field contains.
