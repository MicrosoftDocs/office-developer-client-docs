# 3-D Rotation Properties Section

Shows the current values of a shape's angle of rotation along the x-, y-, and z-axes.
  
> [!NOTE]
> The 3-D Rotation Properties section does not include cells that control shape bevel effects. To set a bevel effect, change the values of the cells in the [Bevel Properties](bevel-properties-section.md) section. 
  
## Remarks

You can change the 3-D rotation values in the **Format Shape** dialog box (**Home** > **Shape Styles** > **Effects** > **3-D Rotation** or by making a change to one of the cells in the **3-D Rotation Properties** section.
