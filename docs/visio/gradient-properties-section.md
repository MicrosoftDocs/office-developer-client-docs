# Gradient Properties Section

Shows the properties for any gradient fill or line color effects applied to the shape. This section also includes cells that control whether a shape's gradient rotates with the shape or whether the shape assumes an applied gradient when grouped with other shapes. 
  
## Remarks

You can set gradient settings in the **Format Shape** dialog box (**Home** > **Shape Styles** > **Fill** > **Fill Options** > **Fill** > **Gradient fill**).
