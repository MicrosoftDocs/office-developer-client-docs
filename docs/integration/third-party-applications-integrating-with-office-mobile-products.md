# Third-party applications integrating with Office Mobile products on Windows, Android, and iOS
 
As an authorized representative of my company, I agree to pass the correct per file ownership type information (whether a file is considered business or personal/consumer), through the Expando Properties on Windows 10, Storage Access Framework on Android, and Document Picker on iOS, to Microsoft. Business file types are those files stored on your storage offering targeted towards businesses. Personal/consumer file types are those files stored on your storage offering targeted towards consumers.
  
I further acknowledge that (a) failure to properly identify documents as consumer or business may result in termination of my company's ability to integrate with Microsoft Office products; and (b) Microsoft may update these terms from time to time, and the onus is on me or another representative acting in my capacity to check and see if new terms apply before passing subsequent file information. If Microsoft changes terms, the effective date found at the top of this content page will indicate said changes, e.g., "updated as of month / year".
