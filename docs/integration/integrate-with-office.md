# Integrate with Office

You can integrate with Office for iOS, Office for Android, Office Online, and Excel, PowerPoint, or Word Mobile from your applications and web-based experiences, enabling your users to transition seamlessly to working in Office applications from third-party solutions.
  
Universal Office, Office for iPad, Office for iPhone, Office for Android tablets, and Office for Android phones can natively integrate with third-party cloud storage providers. You can integrate with Office from your applications to enable users to open, edit, and save documents in Excel, OneNote, PowerPoint, or Word.
  
If you are a cloud storage provider, you can register for our [partner program](http://dev.office.com/programs/officecloudstorage) to integrate with the Office Online apps to enable your users to view and edit Excel, PowerPoint, and Word documents in any web browser.
