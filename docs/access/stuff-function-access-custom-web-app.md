## Syntax

 **Stuff** (*IntoTextExpression*, *Start*, *Length*, *ThisTextExpression*) 
  
The **Stuff** function contains the following arguments. 
  
|**Argument name**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| *IntoTextExpression*  <br/> |A text expression that specifies the text into which the text specified by the  *ThisTextExpression*  will be inserted.  <br/> |
| *Start*  <br/> |An integer value that specifies the location to start deletion and insertion. If start or length is negative, a null string is returned. If start is longer than the first  *IntoTextExpression*  , a null string is returned.  <br/> |
| *Length*  <br/> |An integer that specifies the number of characters to delete. If length is longer than the first  *IntoTextExpression*  , deletion occurs up to the last character in the last  *IntoTextExpression*  .  <br/> |
| *ThisTextExpression*  <br/> |A text expression hat specifies the text to insert into  *IntoTextExpression*  . This expression will replace length characters of  *IntoTextExpression*  beginning at  *Start*  .  <br/> |
   
## Remarks

If the  *Start*  or  *Length*  arguments are negative, or if the starting position is larger than length of the first string, a null string is returned. If the start position is 0, a null value is returned. If the length to delete is longer than the first string, it is deleted to the first character in the first string.
