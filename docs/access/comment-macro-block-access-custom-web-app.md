# Comment Macro Block (Access custom web app)

The **Comment** statement can be used to provide explanatory remarks in a macro. 
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft no longer recommends creating and using Access web apps in SharePoint. As an alternative, consider using [Microsoft PowerApps](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/) to build no-code business solutions for the web and mobile devices. 
  
## Remarks

A **Comment** may be up to 1000 characters in length. However, by default, only the first line of the comment is displayed.
