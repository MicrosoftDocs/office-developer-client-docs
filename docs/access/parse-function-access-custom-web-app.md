## Syntax

 **Parse** (*TextExpression*, *DataType*) 
  
The **Parse** function contains the following arguments. 
  
|**Argument name**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| *TextExpression*  <br/> |A text expression representing the formatted value to parse into the specified data type.  <br/> |
| *DataType*  <br/> |Literal value representing the data type requested for the result.  <br/> |
   
## Remarks

Use **Parse** only for converting from string to date/time and number types. For general type conversions, use the **Convert** function. Keep in mind that there is a certain performance overhead in parsing the string value.
