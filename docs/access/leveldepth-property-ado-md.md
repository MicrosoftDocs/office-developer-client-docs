# LevelDepth Property (ADO MD)

Indicates the number of levels between the root of the hierarchy and a member.
  
## Return Values

Returns a **Long** integer, and is read-only. 
  
## Remarks

Use the **LevelDepth** property to determine the distance of the [Member](member-object-ado-md.md) object from the root level of the hierarchy. The **LevelDepth** of a member at the root level is 0. This corresponds to the [Depth](depth-property-ado-md.md) property of a [Level](level-object-ado-md.md) object.
