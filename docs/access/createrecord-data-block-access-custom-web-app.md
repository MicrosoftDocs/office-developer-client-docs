|[CancelRecordChange Macro Action](cancelrecordchange-macro-action-access-custom-web-app.md) <br/> |
|[Comment Macro Statement](comment-macro-block-access-custom-web-app.md) <br/> |

|[SetLocalVar Macro Action](setlocalvar-macro-action-access-custom-web-app.md) <br/> |
   
After the **CreateRecord** action creates a record, use the **SetField** action to specify a value of a field in the new record. 
  
You can use an **If...Then...Else** statement to perform operations based on a condition. 
  
To cancel the creation of a record, use the **CancelRecordChange** action. This prevents the changes from being committed and exits the **CreateRecord** data block. 
  
Once the new record is committed, you can use the **LastCreateRecordIdentity** local variable to work with the record. For example, use the following syntax to refer to the AssignedTo field of the most recently created record. 
  
`[LastCreateRecordIdentity].[AssignedTo]`
