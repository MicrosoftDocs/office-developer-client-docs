# Grandchild Aggregates


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

The chapter column created in a clause of a shape command may be given a *chapter-alias name* (typically with the AS keyword). You may identify any column in any chapter of the shaped **Recordset** with a fully qualified name identifying the child containing the column. For example, if the parent chapter, chap1, contains a child chapter, chap2, that has an amount column, amt, then the qualified name would be chap1.chap2.amt. The qualified name may then be used as an argument to one of the aggregate functions (SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN, COUNT, STDEV, or ANY).
