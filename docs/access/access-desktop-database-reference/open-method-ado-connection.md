# Open Method (ADO Connection)


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

**In this article**  
Syntax  
Parameters  
Remarks  

Opens a connection to a data source.

## Syntax

*connection*.Open*ConnectionString*, *UserID*, *Password*, *Options*

## Parameters

  - *ConnectionString*

  - Optional. A **String** value that contains connection information. See the [ConnectionString](connectionstring-property-ado.md) property for details on valid settings.

  - *UserID*

  - Optional. A **String** value that contains a user name to use when establishing the connection.

  - *Password*

  - Optional. A **String** value that contains a password to use when establishing the connection.

  - *Options*

  - Optional. A [ConnectOptionEnum](connectoptionenum.md) value that determines whether this method should return after (synchronously) or before (asynchronously) the connection is established.

## Remarks

Using the **Open** method on a [Connection](connection-object-ado.md) object establishes the physical connection to a data source. After this method successfully completes, the connection is live and you can issue commands against it and process the results.

Use the optional *ConnectionString* argument to specify either a connection string containing a series of *argument* *= value* statements separated by semicolons, or a file or directory resource identified with a URL. The **ConnectionString** property automatically inherits the value used for the *ConnectionString* argument. Therefore, you can either set the **ConnectionString** property of the **Connection** object before opening it, or use the *ConnectionString* argument to set or override the current connection parameters during the **Open** method call.

If you pass user and password information both in the *ConnectionString* argument and in the optional *UserID* and *Password* arguments, the *UserID* and *Password* arguments will override the values specified in *ConnectionString*.

When you have concluded your operations over an open **Connection**, use the [Close](close-method-ado.md) method to free any associated system resources. Closing an object does not remove it from memory; you can change its property settings and use the **Open** method to open it again later. To completely eliminate an object from memory, set the object variable to *Nothing*.

**Remote Data Service Usage**When used on a client-side **Connection** object, the **Open** method doesn't actually establish a connection to the server until a [Recordset](recordset-object-ado.md) is opened on the **Connection** object.
