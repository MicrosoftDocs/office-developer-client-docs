About the Contributors  

A **Workspace** object defines a named session for a user. It contains open databases and provides mechanisms for simultaneous transactions and, in Microsoft Access workspaces, secure workgroup support.

## Remarks

A **Workspace** is a non-persistent object that defines how your application interacts with data by using the Microsoft Access database engine. Use the **Workspace** object to manage the current session or to start an additional session. In a session, you can open multiple databases or connections, and manage transactions. For example, you can:

  - Use the **Name**, **UserName**, and **Type** properties to establish a named session. The session creates a scope in which you can open multiple databases and conduct one instance of nested transactions.

  - Use the **Close** method to terminate a session.

  - Use the **OpenDatabase** method to open one or more existing databases on a **Workspace**.

  - Use the **BeginTrans**, **CommitTrans**, and **Rollback** methods to manage nested transaction processing within a **Workspace** and use several **Workspace** objects to conduct multiple, simultaneous, and overlapping transactions.

When you first refer to or use a **Workspace** object, you automatically create the default workspace, DBEngine.Workspaces(0). The settings of the **Name** and **UserName** properties of the default workspace are "\#Default Workspace\#" and "Admin," respectively. If security is enabled, the **UserName** property setting is the name of the user who logged on.

When you use transactions, all databases in the specified **Workspace** are affected— even if multiple **Database** objects are opened in the **Workspace**. For example, you use a **BeginTrans** method, update several records in a database, and then delete records in another database. If you then use the **Rollback** method, both the update and delete operations are canceled and rolled back. You can create additional **Workspace** objects to manage transactions independently across **Database** objects.

You can create **Workspace** objects with the **CreateWorkspace** method. After you create a new **Workspace** object, you must append it to the **Workspaces** collection if you need to refer to it from the **Workspaces** collection.

You can use a newly created **Workspace** object without appending it to the **Workspaces** collection. However, you must refer to it by the object variable to which you have assigned it.

To refer to a **Workspace** object in a collection by its ordinal number or by its **Name** property setting, use any of the following syntax forms:

**DBEngine**.**Workspaces**(0)

**DBEngine**.**Workspaces**("name")

**DBEngine**.**Workspaces**\!\[name\]


> [!NOTE]
> <P>ODBCDirect workspaces are not supported in Microsoft Access 2013. Use ADO if you want to access external data sources without using the Microsoft Access database engine.</P>



## Example

This example creates a new Microsoft Access Workspace object and appends it to the **Workspaces** collection. It then enumerates the **Workspaces** collections and the **Properties** collection of the **Workspace** object.

``` 
Sub WorkspaceX() 
 
   Dim wrkNewAcc As Workspace 
   Dim wrkLoop As Workspace 
   Dim prpLoop As Property 
 
   ' Create a new Microsoft Access workspace. 
   Set wrkNewAcc = CreateWorkspace("NewAccessWorkspace", _ 
      "admin", "", dbUseJet) 
   Workspaces.Append wrkNewAcc 
 
   ' Enumerate the Workspaces collection. 
   For Each wrkLoop In Workspaces 
      With wrkLoop 
         Debug.Print "Properties of " & .Name 
         ' Enumerate the Properties collection of the new 
         ' Workspace object. 
         For Each prpLoop In .Properties 
            On Error Resume Next 
            If prpLoop <> "" Then Debug.Print "  " & _ 
               prpLoop.Name & " = " & prpLoop 
            On Error GoTo 0 
         Next prpLoop 
      End With 
   Next wrkLoop 
 
   wrkNewAcc.Close 
End Sub 
 
```

This example uses the **CreateWorkspace** method to create a Microsoft Access workspace. It then lists the properties of theworkspace.

``` 
Sub CreateWorkspaceX() 
 
   Dim wrkAcc As Workspace 
   Dim wrkLoop As Workspace 
   Dim prpLoop As Property 
 
 
   DefaultType = dbUseJet 
   ' Create an unnamed Workspace object of the type  
   ' specified by the DefaultType property of DBEngine  
   ' (dbUseJet). 
   Set wrkAcc = CreateWorkspace("", "admin", "") 
 
   ' Enumerate Workspaces collection. 
   Debug.Print "Workspace objects in Workspaces collection:" 
   For Each wrkLoop In Workspaces 
      Debug.Print "  " & wrkLoop.Name 
   Next wrkLoop 
 
   With wrkAcc 
      ' Enumerate Properties collection of Microsoft Access  
      ' workspace. 
      Debug.Print _ 
         "Properties of unnamed Microsoft Access workspace" 
      On Error Resume Next 
      For Each prpLoop In .Properties 
         Debug.Print "  " & prpLoop.Name & " = " & prpLoop 
      Next prpLoop 
      On Error GoTo 0 
   End With 
 
   wrkAcc.Close 
 
End Sub 
 
```

The following example shows how to use a transaction in a Data Access Objects (DAO) workspace.
