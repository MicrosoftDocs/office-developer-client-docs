# ConnectComplete and Disconnect Events (ADO)


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

The **ConnectComplete** event is called after a connection *starts*. The **Disconnect** event is called after a connection *ends*.

## Syntax

ConnectComplete*pError*, *adStatus*, *pConnection*

Disconnect*adStatus*, *pConnection*

## Parameters

  - *pError*

  - An [Error](error-object-ado.md) object. It describes the error that occurred if the value of *adStatus* is **adStatusErrorsOccurred**; otherwise it is not set.

  - *adStatus*

  - [EventStatusEnum](eventstatusenum.md)
    
    When **ConnectComplete** is called, this parameter is set to **adStatusCancel** if a **WillConnect** event has requested cancellation of the pending connection.
    
    Before either event returns, set this parameter to **adStatusUnwantedEvent** to prevent subsequent notifications. However, closing and reopening the [Connection](connection-object-ado.md) causes these events to occur again.

  - *pConnection*

  - The **Connection** object for which this event applies.
