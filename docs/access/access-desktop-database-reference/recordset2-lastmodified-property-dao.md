# Recordset2.LastModified Property (DAO)


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

**In this article**  
Syntax  
Remarks  
Example  

Returns a ookmark indicating the most recently added or changed record.

## Syntax

*expression* .LastModified

*expression* A variable that represents a **Recordset2** object.

## Remarks

You can use the **LastModified** property to move to the most recently added or updated record. Use the **LastModified** property with table- and dynaset-type **[Recordset](recordset-object-dao.md)** objects. A record must be added or modified in the **Recordset** object itself in order for the **LastModified** property to have a value.

## Example

This example uses the **LastModified** property to move the current record pointer to both a record that has been modified and a newly created record.

    Sub LastModifiedX() 
     
     Dim dbsNorthwind As Database 
     Dim rstEmployees As Recordset2 
     Dim strFirst As String 
     Dim strLast As String 
     
     Set dbsNorthwind = OpenDatabase("Northwind.mdb") 
     Set rstEmployees = _ 
     dbsNorthwind.OpenRecordset("Employees", _ 
     dbOpenDynaset) 
     
     With rstEmployees 
     ' Store current data. 
     strFirst = !FirstName 
     strLast = !LastName 
     ' Change data in current record. 
     .Edit 
     !FirstName = "Julie" 
     !LastName = "Warren" 
     .Update 
     ' Move current record pointer to the most recently 
     ' changed or added record. 
     .Bookmark = .LastModified 
     Debug.Print _ 
     "Data in LastModified record after Edit: " & _ 
     !FirstName & " " & !LastName 
     
     ' Restore original data because this is a demonstration. 
     .Edit 
     !FirstName = strFirst 
     !LastName = strLast 
     .Update 
     
     ' Add new record. 
     .AddNew 
     !FirstName = "Roger" 
     !LastName = "Harui" 
     .Update 
     ' Move current record pointer to the most recently 
     ' changed or added record. 
     .Bookmark = .LastModified 
     Debug.Print _ 
     "Data in LastModified record after AddNew: " & _ 
     !FirstName & " " & !LastName 
     
     ' Delete new record because this is a demonstration. 
     .Delete 
     .Close 
     End With 
     
     dbsNorthwind.Close 
     
    End Sub 

This example uses the **AddNew** method to create a new record with the specified name. The AddName function is required for this procedure to run.

    Sub AddNewX() 
     
     Dim dbsNorthwind As Database 
     Dim rstEmployees As Recordset2 
     Dim strFirstName As String 
     Dim strLastName As String 
     
     Set dbsNorthwind = OpenDatabase("Northwind.mdb") 
     Set rstEmployees = _ 
     dbsNorthwind.OpenRecordset("Employees", dbOpenDynaset) 
     
     ' Get data from the user. 
     strFirstName = Trim(InputBox( _ 
     "Enter first name:")) 
     strLastName = Trim(InputBox( _ 
     "Enter last name:")) 
     
     ' Proceed only if the user actually entered something 
     ' for both the first and last names. 
     If strFirstName <> "" and strLastName <> "" Then 
     
     ' Call the function that adds the record. 
     AddName rstEmployees, strFirstName, strLastName 
     
     ' Show the newly added data. 
     With rstEmployees 
     Debug.Print "New record: " & !FirstName & _ 
     " " & !LastName 
     ' Delete new record because this is a demonstration. 
     .Delete 
     End With 
     
     Else 
     Debug.Print _ 
     "You must input a string for first and last name!" 
     End If 
     
     rstEmployees.Close 
     dbsNorthwind.Close 
     
    End Sub 
     
    Function AddName(rstTemp As Recordset, _ 
     strFirst As String, strLast As String) 
     
     ' Adds a new record to a Recordset using the data passed 
     ' by the calling procedure. The new record is then made 
     ' the current record. 
     With rstTemp 
     .AddNew 
     !FirstName = strFirst 
     !LastName = strLast 
     .Update 
     .Bookmark = .LastModified 
     End With 
     
    End Function
