# Recordset.RecordCount Property (DAO)


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

**In this article**  
Syntax  
Remarks  
Example  

Returns the number of records accessed in a **[Recordset](recordset-object-dao.md)** object, or the total number of records in a table-type **Recordset** object. or **[TableDef](tabledef-object-dao.md)** object. Read-only **Long**.

## Syntax

*expression* .RecordCount

*expression* A variable that represents a **Recordset** object.

## Remarks

Use the **RecordCount** property to find out how many records in a **Recordset** or **TableDef** object have been accessed. The **RecordCount** property doesn't indicate how many records are contained in a dynaset–, snapshot–, or forward–only–type **Recordset** object until all records have been accessed. Once the last record has been accessed, the **RecordCount** property indicates the total number of undeleted records in the **Recordset** or **TableDef** object. To force the last record to be accessed, use the **[MoveLast](recordset-movelast-method-dao.md)** method on the **Recordset** object. You can also use an SQL **Count** function to determine the approximate number of records your query will return.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Using the <STRONG>MoveLast</STRONG> method to populate a newly opened <STRONG>Recordset</STRONG> negatively impacts performance. Unless it is necessary to have an accurate <STRONG>RecordCount</STRONG> as soon as you open a <STRONG>Recordset</STRONG>, it's better to wait until you populate the <STRONG>Recordset</STRONG> with other portions of code before checking the <STRONG>RecordCount</STRONG> property.</P>



As your application deletes records in a dynaset-type **Recordset** object, the value of the **RecordCount** property decreases. However, records deleted by other users aren't reflected by the **RecordCount** property until the current record is positioned to a deleted record. If you execute a transaction that affects the **RecordCount** property setting and you subsequently roll back the transaction, the **RecordCount** property won't reflect the actual number of remaining records.

The **RecordCount** property of a snapshot– or forward–only–type **Recordset** object isn't affected by changes in the underlying tables.

A **Recordset** or **TableDef** object with no records has a **RecordCount** property setting of 0.

Using the **[Requery](recordset-requery-method-dao.md)** method on a **Recordset** object resets the **RecordCount** property just as if the query were re-executed.

## Example

This example demonstrates the **RecordCount** property with different types of **Recordsets** before and after they're populated.

    Sub RecordCountX() 
     
     Dim dbsNorthwind As Database 
     Dim rstEmployees As Recordset 
     
     Set dbsNorthwind = OpenDatabase("Northwind.mdb") 
     
     With dbsNorthwind 
     ' Open table-type Recordset and show RecordCount 
     ' property. 
     Set rstEmployees = .OpenRecordset("Employees") 
     Debug.Print _ 
     "Table-type recordset from Employees table" 
     Debug.Print " RecordCount = " & _ 
     rstEmployees.RecordCount 
     rstEmployees.Close 
     
     ' Open dynaset-type Recordset and show RecordCount 
     ' property before populating the Recordset. 
     Set rstEmployees = .OpenRecordset("Employees", _ 
     dbOpenDynaset) 
     Debug.Print "Dynaset-type recordset " & _ 
     "from Employees table before MoveLast" 
     Debug.Print " RecordCount = " & _ 
     rstEmployees.RecordCount 
     
     ' Show the RecordCount property after populating the 
     ' Recordset. 
     rstEmployees.MoveLast 
     Debug.Print "Dynaset-type recordset " & _ 
     "from Employees table after MoveLast" 
     Debug.Print " RecordCount = " & _ 
     rstEmployees.RecordCount 
     rstEmployees.Close 
     
     ' Open snapshot-type Recordset and show RecordCount 
     ' property before populating the Recordset. 
     Set rstEmployees = .OpenRecordset("Employees", _ 
     dbOpenSnapshot) 
     Debug.Print "Snapshot-type recordset " & _ 
     "from Employees table before MoveLast" 
     Debug.Print " RecordCount = " & _ 
     rstEmployees.RecordCount 
     
     ' Show the RecordCount property after populating the 
     ' Recordset. 
     rstEmployees.MoveLast 
     Debug.Print "Snapshot-type recordset " & _ 
     "from Employees table after MoveLast" 
     Debug.Print " RecordCount = " & _ 
     rstEmployees.RecordCount 
     rstEmployees.Close 
     
     ' Open forward-only-type Recordset and show 
     ' RecordCount property before populating the 
     ' Recordset. 
     Set rstEmployees = .OpenRecordset("Employees", _ 
     dbOpenForwardOnly) 
     Debug.Print "Forward-only-type recordset " & _ 
     "from Employees table before MoveLast" 
     Debug.Print " RecordCount = " & _ 
     rstEmployees.RecordCount 
     
     ' Show the RecordCount property after calling the 
     ' MoveNext method. 
     rstEmployees.MoveNext 
     Debug.Print "Forward-only-type recordset " & _ 
     "from Employees table after MoveNext" 
     Debug.Print " RecordCount = " & _ 
     rstEmployees.RecordCount 
     rstEmployees.Close 
     
     .Close 
     End With 
     
    End Sub
