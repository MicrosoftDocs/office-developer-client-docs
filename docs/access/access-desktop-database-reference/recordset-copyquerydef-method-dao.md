# Recordset.CopyQueryDef Method (DAO)


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

**In this article**  
Syntax  
Remarks  
Example  

Returns a **[QueryDef](querydef-object-dao.md)** object that is a copy of the **QueryDef** used to create the **[Recordset](recordset-object-dao.md)** object represented by the recordset placeholder (Microsoft Access workspaces only). .

## Syntax

*expression* .CopyQueryDef

*expression* A variable that represents a **Recordset** object.

### Return Value

QueryDef

## Remarks

You can use the **CopyQueryDef** method to create a new **QueryDef** that is a duplicate of the **QueryDef** used to create the **Recordset**.

If a **QueryDef** wasn't used to create this **Recordset**, an error occurs. You must first open a **Recordset** with the **OpenRecordset** method before using the **CopyQueryDef** method.

This method is useful when you create a **Recordset** object from a **QueryDef**, and pass the **Recordset** to a function, and the function must re-create the SQL equivalent of the query, for example, to modify it in some way.

## Example

This example uses the **CopyQueryDef** method to create a copy of a **QueryDef** from an existing **Recordset** and modifies the copy by adding a clause to the SQL property. When you create a permanent **QueryDef**, spaces, semicolons, or linefeeds may be added to the SQL property; these extra characters must be stripped before any new clauses can be attached to the SQL statement.

    Function CopyQueryNew(rstTemp As Recordset, _ 
     strAdd As String) As QueryDef 
     
     Dim strSQL As String 
     Dim strRightSQL As String 
     
     Set CopyQueryNew = rstTemp.CopyQueryDef 
     With CopyQueryNew 
     ' Strip extra characters. 
     strSQL = .SQL 
     strRightSQL = Right(strSQL, 1) 
     Do While strRightSQL = " " Or strRightSQL = ";" Or _ 
     strRightSQL = Chr(10) Or strRightSQL = vbCr 
     strSQL = Left(strSQL, Len(strSQL) - 1) 
     strRightSQL = Right(strSQL, 1) 
     Loop 
     .SQL = strSQL & strAdd 
     End With 
     
    End Function 
     
    This example shows 

This example shows a possible use of CopyQueryNew().

```

 Dim strOrderBy As String 
 Dim qdfCopy As QueryDef 
 Dim rstCopy As Recordset 
 
 Set dbsNorthwind = OpenDatabase("Northwind.mdb") 
 Set qdfEmployees = dbsNorthwind.CreateQueryDef( _ 
 "NewQueryDef", "SELECT FirstName, LastName, " & _ 
 "BirthDate FROM Employees") 
 Set rstEmployees = qdfEmployees.OpenRecordset( _ 
 dbOpenForwardOnly) 
 
 Do While True 
 intCommand = Val(InputBox( _ 
 "Choose field on which to order a new " & _ 
 "Recordset:" & vbCr & "1 - FirstName" & vbCr & _ 
 "2 - LastName" & vbCr & "3 - BirthDate" & vbCr & _ 
 "[Cancel - exit]")) 
 Select Case intCommand 
 Case 1 
 strOrderBy = " ORDER BY FirstName" 
 Case 2 
 strOrderBy = " ORDER BY LastName" 
 Case 3 
 strOrderBy = " ORDER BY BirthDate" 
 Case Else

 End Select 
 Set qdfCopy = CopyQueryNew(rstEmployees, strOrderBy) 
 Set rstCopy = qdfCopy.OpenRecordset(dbOpenSnapshot, _ 
 dbForwardOnly) 
 With rstCopy 
 Do While Not .EOF 
 Debug.Print !LastName & ", " & !FirstName & _ 
 " - " & !BirthDate 
 .MoveNext 
 Loop 
 .Close 
 End With 
 Exit Do 
 Loop 
 
 rstEmployees.Close 
 ' Delete new QueryDef because this is a demonstration. 
 dbsNorthwind.QueryDefs.Delete qdfEmployees.Name 
 dbsNorthwind.Close 
 
End Sub
