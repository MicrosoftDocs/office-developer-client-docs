# Index.DistinctCount Property (DAO)


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

**In this article**  
Syntax  
Remarks  
Example  

Returns a value that indicates the number of unique values for the **[Index](index-object-dao.md)** object that are included in the associated table (Microsoft Access workspaces only).

## Syntax

*expression* .DistinctCount

*expression* A variable that represents an **Index** object.

## Remarks

Check the **DistinctCount** property to determine the number of unique values, or keys, in an index. Any key is counted only once, even though there may be multiple occurrences of that value if the index permits duplicate values. This information is useful in applications that attempt to optimize data access by evaluating index information. The number of unique values is also known as the cardinality of an **Index** object.

The **DistinctCount** property won't always reflect the actual number of keys at a particular time. For example, a change caused by a rolled back transaction won't be reflected immediately in the **DistinctCount** property. The **DistinctCount** property value also may not reflect the deletion of records with unique keys. The number will be accurate immediately after you use the **[CreateIndex](tabledef-createindex-method-dao.md)** method.

## Example

This example uses the **DistinctCount** property to show how you can determine the number of unique values in an **Index** object. However, this value is only accurate immediately after creating the **Index**. It will remain accurate if no keys change, or if new keys are added and no old keys are deleted; otherwise, it will not be reliable. (If this procedure is run several times, you can see the effect on the **DistinctCount** property values of the existing Index objects.)
