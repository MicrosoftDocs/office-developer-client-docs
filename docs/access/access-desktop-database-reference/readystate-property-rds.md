# ReadyState Property (RDS)


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

Indicates the progress of a [DataControl](datacontrol-object-rds.md) object as it retrieves data into its [Recordset](recordset-object-ado.md) object.

## Settings and Return Values

Sets or returns one of the following values.

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><p>Value</p></th>
<th><p>Description</p></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>adcReadyStateLoaded</strong></p></td>
<td><p>The current query is still executing and no rows have been fetched. The <strong>DataControl</strong> object's <strong>Recordset</strong> is not available for use.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p><strong>adcReadyStateInteractive</strong></p></td>
<td><p>An initial set of rows retrieved by the current query has been stored in the <strong>DataControl</strong> object's <strong>Recordset</strong> and are available for use. The remaining rows are still being fetched.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>adcReadyStateComplete</strong></p></td>
<td><p>All rows retrieved by the current query have been stored in the <strong>DataControl</strong> object's <strong>Recordset</strong> and are available for use. This state will also exist if an operation aborted due to an error, or if the <strong>Recordset</strong> object is not initialized.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>



> [!NOTE]
> <P>Each client-side executable file that uses these constants must provide declarations for them. You can cut and paste the constant declarations you want from the file Adcvbs.inc, located in the C:\Program Files\Common Files\System\MSADC folder.</P>



## Remarks

Use the [onReadyStateChange](onreadystatechange-event-rds.md) event to monitor changes in the **ReadyState** property during an asynchronous query operation. This is more efficient than periodically checking the value of the property.

If an error occurs during an asynchronous operation, the **ReadyState** property changes to **adcReadyStateComplete**, the [State](state-property-ado.md) property changes from **adStateExecuting** to **adStateClosed**, and the **Recordset** object [Value](value-property-ado.md) property remains *Nothing*.
