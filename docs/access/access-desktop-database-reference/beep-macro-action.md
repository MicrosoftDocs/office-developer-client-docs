# Beep Macro Action


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

You can use the **Beep** action to sound a beep tone through the computer's speaker.

## Setting

The **Beep** action doesn't have any arguments.

## Remarks

You can use the **Beep** action to signal the following occurrences:

  - Important screen changes have occurred.

  - The wrong kind of data has been entered in a control. For example, the user has entered numeric data in a text box control.

  - A macro has reached a specified point or has completed its actions.

The frequency and duration of the beep depend on the hardware, which may vary between computers.
