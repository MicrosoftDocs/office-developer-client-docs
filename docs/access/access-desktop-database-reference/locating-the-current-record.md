# Locating the Current Record


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

The current position of the cursor in the **Recordset** delineates the current record position. Assuming that the command issued returns results, the cursor is automatically placed at the first record when the **Recordset** **Open** method is called. So, with the sample **Recordset**, the cursor would be on the first record, "Uncle Bob's Organic Dried Pears."
