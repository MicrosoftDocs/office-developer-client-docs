# SaveToFile Method (ADO)


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

**In this article**  
Syntax  
Parameters  
Remarks  

Saves the binary contents of a [Stream](stream-object-ado.md) to a file.

## Syntax

*Stream*.SaveToFile*FileName*, *SaveOptions*

## Parameters

  - *FileName*

  - A **String** value that contains the fully-qualified name of the file to which the contents of the **Stream** will be saved. You can save to any valid local location, or any location you have access to via a UNC value.

  - *SaveOptions*

  - A [SaveOptionsEnum](saveoptionsenum.md) value that specifies whether a new file should be created by **SaveToFile**, if it does not already exist. Default value is **adSaveCreateNotExists**. With these options you can specify that an error occurs if the specified file does not exist. You can also specify that **SaveToFile** overwrites the current contents of an existing file.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>If you overwrite an existing file (when <STRONG>adSaveCreateOverwrite</STRONG> is set), <STRONG>SaveToFile</STRONG> truncates any bytes from the original existing file that follow the new <A href="eos-property-ado.md">EOS</A>.</P>



## Remarks

**SaveToFile** may be used to copy the contents of a **Stream** object to a local file. There is no change in the contents or properties of the **Stream** object. The **Stream** object must be open before calling **SaveToFile**.

This method does not change the association of the **Stream** object to its underlying source. The **Stream** object will still be associated with the original URL or **Record** that was its source when opened.

After a **SaveToFile** operation, the current position ([Position](position-property-ado.md)) in the stream is set to the beginning of the stream (0).
