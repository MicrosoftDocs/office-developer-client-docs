# Fields Collection (ADO)


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

Contains all the [Field](field-object-ado.md) objects of a [Recordset](recordset-object-ado.md) or [Record](record-object-ado.md) object.

## Remarks

A **Recordset** object has a **Fields** collection made up of **Field** objects. Each **Field** object corresponds to a column in the **Recordset**. You can populate the **Fields** collection before opening the **Recordset** by calling the [Refresh](refresh-method-ado.md) method on the collection.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>See the <STRONG>Field</STRONG> object topic for a more detailed explanation of how to use <STRONG>Field</STRONG> objects.</P>



The **Fields** collection has an [Append](append-method-ado.md) method, which provisionally creates and adds a **Field** object to the collection, and an **Update** method, which finalizes any additions or deletions.

A **Record** object has two special fields that can be indexed with [FieldEnum](fieldenum.md) constants. One constant accesses a field containing the default stream for the **Record**, and the other accesses a field containing the absolute URL string for the **Record**.

Certain providers (for example, the [Microsoft OLE DB Provider for Internet Publishing](microsoft-ole-db-provider-for-internet-publishing.md)) may populate the **Fields** collection with a subset of available fields for the **Record** or **Recordset**. Other fields will not be added to the collection until they are first referenced by name or indexed by your code.

If you attempt to reference a nonexistent field by name, a new **Field** object will be appended to the **Fields** collection with a [Status](status-property-ado-field.md) of **adFieldPendingInsert**. When you call [Update](update-method-ado.md), ADO will create a new field in your data source if allowed by your provider.
