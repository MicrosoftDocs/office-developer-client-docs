# Name Property (ADO)


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

Indicates the name of an object.

## Settings and Return Values

Sets or returns a **String** value that indicates the name of an object.

## Remarks

Use the **Name** property to assign a name to or retrieve the name of a **Command**, **Property**, **Field**, or **Parameter** object.

The value is read/write on a **Command** object and read-only on a **Property** object.

For a **Field** object, **Name** is normally read-only. However, for new **Field** objects that have been appended to the [Fields](fields-collection-ado.md) collection of a [Record](record-object-ado.md), **Name** is read/write only after the [Value](value-property-ado.md) property for the **Field** has been specified and the data provider has successfully added the new **Field** by calling the [Update](update-method-ado.md) method of the **Fields** collection.

For **Parameter** objects not yet appended to the [Parameters](parameters-collection-ado.md) collection, the **Name** property is read/write. For appended **Parameter** objects and all other objects, the **Name** property is read-only. Names do not have to be unique within a collection.

You can retrieve the **Name** property of an object by an ordinal reference, after which you can refer to the object directly by name. For example, if rstMain.Properties(20).Name yields Updatability , you can subsequently refer to this property as yields Updatability , you can subsequently refer to this property as rstMain.Properties("Updatability") .
