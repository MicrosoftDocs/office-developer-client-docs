# Recordset2.Transactions Property (DAO)


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

**In this article**  
Syntax  
Remarks  
Example  

Returns a value that indicates whether an object supports transactions. Read-only **Boolean**.

## Syntax

*expression* .Transactions

*expression* A variable that represents a **Recordset2** object.

## Remarks

In a Microsoft Access workspace, you can also use the **Transactions** property with dynaset- or table-type **Recordset** objects. Snapshot- and forward–only–type **[Recordset](recordset-object-dao.md)** objects always return **False**.

If a dynaset- or table-type **Recordset** is based on a Microsoft Access database engine table, the **Transactions** property is **True** and you can use transactions. Other database engines may not support transactions. For example, you can't use transactions in a dynaset-type **Recordset** object based on a Paradox table.

Check the **Transactions** property before using the **[BeginTrans](dbengine-begintrans-method-dao.md)** method on the **Recordset** object's **[Workspace](workspace-object-dao.md)** object to make sure that transactions are supported. Using the **BeginTrans**, **CommitTrans**, or **Rollback** methods on an unsupported object has no effect.

## Example

This example demonstrates the **Transactions** property in Microsoft Access workspaces.

``` 
Sub TransactionsX() 
 
 Dim wrkAcc As Workspace 
 Dim dbsNorthwind As Database 
 Dim conPubs As Connection 
 Dim rstTemp As Recordset 
 
 Set wrkAcc = CreateWorkspace("", "admin", "", dbUseJet) 
 Set dbsNorthwind = wrkAcc.OpenDatabase("Northwind.mdb") 
 
 ' Open two different Recordset objects and display the 
 ' Transactions property of each. 
 
 Debug.Print "Opening Microsoft Access table-type " & _ 
 "recordset..." 
 Set rstTemp = dbsNorthwind.OpenRecordset( _ 
 "Employees", dbOpenTable) 
 Debug.Print " Transactions = " & rstTemp.Transactions 
 
 Debug.Print "Opening forward-only-type " & _ 
 "recordset where the source is an SQL statement..." 
 Set rstTemp = dbsNorthwind.OpenRecordset( _ 
 "SELECT * FROM Employees", dbOpenForwardOnly) 
 Debug.Print " Transactions = " & rstTemp.Transactions 
 
 rstTemp.Close 
 dbsNorthwind.Close 
 conPubs.Close 
 wrkAcc.Close 
End Sub 
 
```
