# Count Property (ADO)


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

Indicates the number of objects in a collection.

## Return Value

Returns a **Long** value.

## Remarks

Use the **Count** property to determine how many objects are in a given collection.

Because numbering for members of a collection begins with zero, you should always code loops starting with the zero member and ending with the value of the **Count** property minus 1. If you are using Microsoft Visual Basic and want to loop through the members of a collection without checking the **Count** property, use the **For** **Each...Next** command.

If the **Count** property is zero, there are no objects in the collection.
