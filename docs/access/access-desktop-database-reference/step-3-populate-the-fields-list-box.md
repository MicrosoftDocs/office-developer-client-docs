## Step 3: Populate the Fields List Box

**To populate the Fields list box**

Insert the following code into the Click event handler of lstMain:

``` 
 
Private Sub lstMain_Click() 
    Dim rec As Record 
    Dim rs As Recordset 
    Set rec = New Record 
    Set rs = New Recordset 
    grs.MoveFirst 
    grs.Move lstMain.ListIndex 
    lstDetails.Clear 
    rec.Open grs 
    Select Case rec.RecordType 
        Case adCollectionRecord: 
            Set rs = rec.GetChildren 
            While Not rs.EOF 
                lstDetails.AddItem rs(0) 
                rs.MoveNext 
            Wend 
        Case adSimpleRecord: 
            recFields rec, lstDetails, txtDetails 
             
        Case adStructDoc: 
    End Select 
     
End Sub 
```

This code declares and instantiates local **Record** and **Recordset** objects, rec and and rs, respectively.

The row corresponding to the resource selected in lstMain is made the current row of grs. Then the **Details** list box is cleared and rec is opened with the current row of . Then the **Details** list box is cleared and rec is opened with the current row of grs as the source.

If the resource is a collection record (as specified by **RecordType**), the local **Recordset**, rs, is opened on the children of rec. Then lstDetails is filled with the values from the rows of is opened on the children of rec. Then lstDetails is filled with the values from the rows of rs.

If the resource is a simple record, recFields is called. For more information about recFields, see the next step.

No code is implemented if the resource is a structured document.
