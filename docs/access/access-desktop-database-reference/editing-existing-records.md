# Editing Existing Records


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

To edit existing records, move to the row you want to edit and change the **Value** property of the fields you want to change. For more information about the **Field** object's **Value** property, see [Chapter 3: Examining Data](chapter-3-examining-data.md). Depending on your cursor type, you will use **Update** or **UpdateBatch** to send changes back to the data source. For more information, see [Chapter 5: Updating and Persisting Data](chapter-5-updating-and-persisting-data.md).

It is usually more efficient to use a stored procedure with a command object to perform updates, as well as to perform other operations, because a stored procedure does not require the creation of a cursor. For more information about cursors, see [Chapter 8: Understanding Cursors and Locks](chapter-8-understanding-cursors-and-locks.md).
