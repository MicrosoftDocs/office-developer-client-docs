# Recordset.MoveLast Method (DAO)


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

Moves to the last record in a specified **Recordset** object and make that record the current record.

## Syntax

*expression* .MoveLast(***Options***)

*expression* A variable that represents a **Recordset** object.

### Parameters

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 25%" />
<col style="width: 25%" />
<col style="width: 25%" />
<col style="width: 25%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><p>Name</p></th>
<th><p>Required/Optional</p></th>
<th><p>Data Type</p></th>
<th><p>Description</p></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Options</p></td>
<td><p>Optional</p></td>
<td><p><strong>Long</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Set to <strong>dbRunAsync</strong> to rune the call to <strong>MoveLast</strong> asynchronously.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


## Remarks

Use the **Move** methods to move from record to record without applying a condition.

If you edit the current record, be sure you use the **Update** method to save the changes before you move to another record. If you move to another record without updating, your changes are lost without warning.

When you open a **Recordset**, the first record is current and the **BOF** property is **False**. If the **Recordset** contains no records, the **BOF** property is **True**, and there is no current record.

If the first or last record is already current when you use **MoveFirst** or **MoveLast**, the current record doesn't change.

If recordset refers to a table-type **Recordset** (Microsoft Access workspaces only), movement follows the current index. You can set the current index by using the **Index** property. If you don't set the current index, the order of returned records is undefined.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>You can use the <STRONG>MoveLast</STRONG> method to fully populate a dynaset- or snapshot-type <STRONG>Recordset</STRONG> to provide the current number of records in the <STRONG>Recordset</STRONG>. However, if you use <STRONG>MoveLast</STRONG> in this way, you can slow down your application's performance. You should only use <STRONG>MoveLast</STRONG> to get a record count if it is absolutely necessary to obtain an accurate record count on a newly opened <STRONG>Recordset</STRONG>. If you use the <STRONG>dbRunAsync</STRONG> constant with <STRONG>MoveLast</STRONG>, the method call is asynchronous. You can use the <STRONG>StillExecuting</STRONG> property to determine when the <STRONG>Recordset</STRONG> is fully populated, and you can use the <STRONG>Cancel</STRONG> method to terminate execution of the asynchronous <STRONG>MoveLast</STRONG> method call.</P>



You can't use the **MoveFirst**, **MoveLast**, and **MovePrevious** methods on a forward–only–type **Recordset** object.

To move the position of the current record in a **Recordset** object a specific number of records forward or backward, use the **Move** method.
