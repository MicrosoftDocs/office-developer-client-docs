# Catalog Object (ADOX)


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

Contains collections ([Tables](tables-collection-adox.md), [Views](views-collection-adox.md), [Users](users-collection-adox.md), [Groups](groups-collection-adox.md), and [Procedures](procedures-collection-adox.md)) that describe the schema catalog of a data source.

## Remarks

You can modify the **Catalog** object by adding or removing objects or by modifying existing objects. Some providers may not support all of the **Catalog** objects or may support only viewing schema information.

With the properties and methods of a **Catalog** object, you can:

  - Open the catalog by setting the [ActiveConnection](activeconnection-property-adox.md) property to an ADO [Connection](connection-object-ado.md) object or a valid connection string.

  - Create a new catalog with the [Create](create-method-adox.md) method.

  - Determine the owners of the objects in a **Catalog** with the [GetObjectOwner](getobjectowner-method-adox.md) and [SetObjectOwner](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/jj249006\(v=office.15\)) methods.
