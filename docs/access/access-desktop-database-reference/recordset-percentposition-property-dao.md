# Recordset.PercentPosition Property (DAO)


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

**In this article**  
Syntax  
Remarks  
Example  

Sets or returns a value indicating the approximate location of the current record in the **[Recordset](recordset-object-dao.md)** object based on a percentage of the records in the **Recordset**.

## Syntax

*expression* .PercentPosition

*expression* A variable that represents a **Recordset** object.

## Remarks

To indicate or change the approximate position of the current record in a **Recordset** object, you can check or set the **PercentPosition** property. When working with a dynaset- or snapshot-type **Recordset** object opened directly from a base table, first populate the **Recordset** object by moving to the last record before you set or check the **PercentPosition** property. If you use the **PercentPosition** property before fully populating the **Recordset** object, the amount of movement is relative to the number of records accessed as indicated by the **[RecordCount](recordset-recordcount-property-dao.md)** property setting. You can move to the last record by using the **[MoveLast](recordset-movelast-method-dao.md)** method.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Using the <STRONG>PercentPosition</STRONG> property to move the current record to a specific record in a <STRONG>Recordset</STRONG> object isn't recommended?the <STRONG><A href="recordset-bookmark-property-dao.md">Bookmark</A></STRONG> property is better suited for this task.</P>



Once you set the **PercentPosition** property to a value, the record at the approximate position corresponding to that value becomes current, and the **PercentPosition** property is reset to a value that reflects the approximate position of the current record. For example, if your **Recordset** object contains only five records, and you set its **PercentPosition** property value to 77, the value returned from the **PercentPosition** property may be 80, not 77.

The **PercentPosition** property applies to all types of **Recordset** objects except for forward–only–type **Recordset** objects or **Recordset** objects opened from pass-through queries against remote databases.

You can use the **PercentPosition** property with a scroll bar on a form or text box to indicate the location of the current record in a **Recordset** object.

## Example

This example uses the **PercentPosition** property to show the position of the current record pointer relative to the beginning of the **Recordset**.

    Sub PercentPositionX() 
     
     Dim dbsNorthwind As Database 
     Dim rstProducts As Recordset 
     Dim strFind As String 
     Dim strMessage As String 
     
     Set dbsNorthwind = OpenDatabase("Northwind.mdb") 
     ' PercentPosition only works with dynasets or snapshots. 
     Set rstProducts = dbsNorthwind.OpenRecordset( _ 
     "SELECT ProductName FROM Products " & _ 
     "ORDER BY ProductName", dbOpenSnapshot) 
     
     With rstProducts 
     ' Populate the Recordset. 
     .MoveLast 
     .MoveFirst 
     
     Do While True 
     ' Show current record information and ask user 
     ' for input. 
     strMessage = "Product: " & !ProductName & vbCr & _ 
     "The record pointer is " & _ 
     Format(.PercentPosition, "##0.0") & _ 
     "% from the " & vbCr & _ 
     "beginning of the Recordset." & vbCr & _ 
     "Please enter a character search string " & _ 
     "for a product name." 
     strFind = Trim(InputBox(strMessage)) 
     If strFind = "" Then Exit Do 
     
     ' Try to find a record matching the search string. 
     .FindFirst "ProductName >= '" & strFind & "'" 
     If .NoMatch Then .MoveLast 
     Loop 
     
     .Close 
     End With 
     
     dbsNorthwind.Close 
     
    End Sub
