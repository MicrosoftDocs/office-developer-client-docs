# Resync Command Property--Dynamic (ADO)


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

Specifies a user-supplied command string that the [Resync](resync-method-ado.md) method issues to refresh the data in the table named in the [Unique Table](unique-table-unique-schema-unique-catalog-properties-dynamic-ado.md) dynamic property.

## Settings and Return Values

Sets or returns a **String** value which is a command string.

## Remarks

The [Recordset](recordset-object-ado.md) object is the result of a JOIN operation executed on multiple base tables. The rows affected depend on the *AffectRecords* parameter of the [Resync](resync-method-ado.md) method. The standard **Resync** method is executed if the [Unique Table](unique-table-unique-schema-unique-catalog-properties-dynamic-ado.md) and **Resync Command** properties are not set.

The command string of the **Resync Command** property is a parameterized command or stored procedure that uniquely identifies the row being refreshed, and returns a single row containing the same number and order of columns as the row to be refreshed. The command string contains a parameter for each primary key column in the **Unique Table**; otherwise, a run-time error is returned. The parameters are automatically filled in with primary key values from the row to be refreshed.

Here are two examples based on SQL:

1\) The **Recordset** is defined by a command:

``` sql
SELECT * FROM Customers JOIN Orders ON 
   Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID
   WHERE city = Seattle
   ORDER BY CustomerID
```

The **Resync Command** property is set to:

``` sql
"SELECT * FROM 
   (SELECT * FROM Customers JOIN Orders 
   ON Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID
   city = Seattle ORDER BY CustomerID)
WHERE Orders.OrderID = ?"
```

The **Unique Table** is *Orders* and its primary key, *OrderID*, is parameterized. The sub-select provides a simple way to programmatically ensure that the same number and order of columns are returned as by the original command.

2\) The **Recordset** is defined by a stored procedure:

``` sql
CREATE PROC Custorders @CustomerID char(5) AS 
SELECT * FROM Customers JOIN Orders ON 
Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID 
WHERE Customers.CustomerID = @CustomerID
```

The **Resync** method should execute the following stored procedure:

``` sql
CREATE PROC CustordersResync @ordid int AS 
SELECT * FROM Customers JOIN Orders ON 
Customers.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID
WHERE Orders.ordid  = @ordid
```

The **Resync Command** property is set to:

    "{call CustordersResync (?)}"

Once again, the **Unique Table** is *Orders* and its primary key, *OrderID*, is parameterized.

**Resync Command** is a dynamic property appended to the **Recordset** object [Properties](properties-collection-ado.md) collection when the [CursorLocation](cursorlocation-property-ado.md) property is set to **adUseClient**.
