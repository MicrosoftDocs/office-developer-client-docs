# Recordset2.Seek Method (DAO)


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

**In this article**  
Syntax  
Remarks  
Example  

Locates the record in an indexed table-type **Recordset** object that satisfies the specified criteria for the current index and makes that record the current record (Microsoft Access workspaces only).

## Syntax

*expression* .Seek(***Comparison***, ***Key1***, ***Key2***, ***Key3***, ***Key4***, ***Key5***, ***Key6***, ***Key7***, ***Key8***, ***Key9***, ***Key10***, ***Key11***, ***Key12***, ***Key13***)

*expression* A variable that represents a **Recordset2** object.

### Parameters

<colgroup>
<col style="width: 25%" />
<col style="width: 25%" />
<col style="width: 25%" />
<col style="width: 25%" />

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


## Remarks

You must set the current index with the **Index** property before you use **Seek**. If the index identifies a nonunique key field, **Seek** locates the first record that satisfies the criteria.

The **Seek** method searches through the specified key fields and locates the first record that satisfies the criteria specified by comparison and key1. Once found, it makes that record current and sets the **NoMatch** property to **False**. If the **Seek** method fails to locate a match, the **NoMatch** property is set to **True**, and the current record is undefined.

If comparison is equal (=), greater than or equal (\>=), or greater than (\>), **Seek** starts at the beginning of the index and searches forward.

If comparison is less than (\<) or less than or equal (\<=), **Seek** starts at the end of the index and searches backward. However, if there are duplicate index entries at the end of the index, **Seek** starts at an arbitrary entry among the duplicates and then searches backward.

You must specify values for all fields defined in the index. If you use **Seek** with a multiple-column index, and you don't specify a comparison value for every field in the index, then you cannot use the equal (=) operator in the comparison. That's because some of the criteria fields (key2, key3, and so on) will default to Null, which will probably not match. Therefore, the equal operator will work correctly only if you have a record which is all **null** except the key you're looking for. It's recommended that you use the greater than or equal (\>=) operator instead.

The key1 argument must be of the same field data type as the corresponding field in the current index. For example, if the current index refers to a number field (such as Employee ID), key1 must be numeric. Similarly, if the current index refers to a Text field (such as Last Name), key1 must be a string.

There doesn't have to be a current record when you use **Seek**.

You can use the **[Indexes](indexes-collection-dao.md)** collection to enumerate the existing indexes.

To locate a record in a dynaset- or snapshot-type **Recordset** that satisfies a specific condition that is not covered by existing indexes, use the **[Find](recordset2-findfirst-method-dao.md)** methods. To include all records, not just those that satisfy a specific condition, use the **[Move](recordset-movefirst-method-dao.md)** methods to move from record to record.

You can't use the **Seek** method on a linked table because you can't open linked tables as table-type **Recordset** objects. However, if you use the **[OpenDatabase](dbengine-opendatabase-method-dao.md)** method to directly open an installable ISAM (non-ODBC) database, you can use **Seek** on tables in that database.

## Example

This example demonstrates the **Seek** method by allowing the user to search for a product based on an ID number.

    Sub SeekX() 
     
     Dim dbsNorthwind As Database 
     Dim rstProducts As Recordset2 
     Dim intFirst As Integer 
     Dim intLast As Integer 
     Dim strMessage As String 
     Dim strSeek As String 
     Dim varBookmark As Variant 
     
     Set dbsNorthwind = OpenDatabase("Northwind.mdb") 
     ' You must open a table-type Recordset to use an index, 
     ' and hence the Seek method. 
     Set rstProducts = _ 
     dbsNorthwind.OpenRecordset("Products", dbOpenTable) 
     
     With rstProducts 
     ' Set the index. 
     .Index = "PrimaryKey" 
     
     ' Get the lowest and highest product IDs. 
     .MoveLast 
     intLast = !ProductID 
     .MoveFirst 
     intFirst = !ProductID 
     
     Do While True 
     ' Display current record information and ask user 
     ' for ID number. 
     strMessage = "Product ID: " & !ProductID & vbCr & _ 
     "Name: " & !ProductName & vbCr & vbCr & _ 
     "Enter a product ID between " & intFirst & _ 
     " and " & intLast & "." 
     strSeek = InputBox(strMessage) 
     
     If strSeek = "" Then Exit Do 
     
     ' Store current bookmark in case the Seek fails. 
     varBookmark = .Bookmark 
     
     .Seek "=", Val(strSeek) 
     
     ' Return to the current record if the Seek fails. 
     If .NoMatch Then 
     MsgBox "ID not found!" 
     .Bookmark = varBookmark 
     End If 
     Loop 
     
     .Close 
     End With 
     
     dbsNorthwind.Close 
     
    End Sub 

This example uses the **NoMatch** property to determine whether a **Seek** and a **FindFirst** were successful, and if not, to give appropriate feedback. The SeekMatch and FindMatch procedures are required for this procedure to run.

    Sub NoMatchX() 
     
     Dim dbsNorthwind As Database 
     Dim rstProducts As Recordset2 
     Dim rstCustomers As Recordset2 
     Dim strMessage As String 
     Dim strSeek As String 
     Dim strCountry As String 
     Dim varBookmark As Variant 
     
     Set dbsNorthwind = OpenDatabase("Northwind.mdb") 
     ' Default is dbOpenTable; required if Index property will 
     ' be used. 
     Set rstProducts = dbsNorthwind.OpenRecordset("Products") 
     
     With rstProducts 
     .Index = "PrimaryKey" 
     
     Do While True 
     ' Show current record information; ask user for 
     ' input. 
     strMessage = "NoMatch with Seek method" & vbCr & _ 
     "Product ID: " & !ProductID & vbCr & _ 
     "Product Name: " & !ProductName & vbCr & _ 
     "NoMatch = " & .NoMatch & vbCr & vbCr & _ 
     "Enter a product ID." 
     strSeek = InputBox(strMessage) 
     If strSeek = "" Then Exit Do 
     
     ' Call procedure that seeks for a record based on 
     ' the ID number supplied by the user. 
     SeekMatch rstProducts, Val(strSeek) 
     Loop 
     
     .Close 
     End With 
     
     Set rstCustomers = dbsNorthwind.OpenRecordset( _ 
     "SELECT CompanyName, Country FROM Customers " & _ 
     "ORDER BY CompanyName", dbOpenSnapshot) 
     
     With rstCustomers 
     
     Do While True 
     ' Show current record information; ask user for 
     ' input. 
     strMessage = "NoMatch with FindFirst method" & _ 
     vbCr & "Customer Name: " & !CompanyName & _ 
     vbCr & "Country: " & !Country & vbCr & _ 
     "NoMatch = " & .NoMatch & vbCr & vbCr & _ 
     "Enter country on which to search." 
     strCountry = Trim(InputBox(strMessage)) 
     If strCountry = "" Then Exit Do 
     
     ' Call procedure that finds a record based on 
     ' the country name supplied by the user. 
     FindMatch rstCustomers, _ 
     "Country = '" & strCountry & "'" 
     Loop 
     
     .Close 
     End With 
     
     dbsNorthwind.Close 
     
    End Sub 
     
    Sub SeekMatch(rstTemp As Recordset, _ 
     intSeek As Integer) 
     
     Dim varBookmark As Variant 
     Dim strMessage As String 
     
     With rstTemp 
     ' Store current record location. 
     varBookmark = .Bookmark 
     .Seek "=", intSeek 
     
     ' If Seek method fails, notify user and return to the 
     ' last current record. 
     If .NoMatch Then 
     strMessage = _ 
     "Not found! Returning to current record." & _ 
     vbCr & vbCr & "NoMatch = " & .NoMatch 
     MsgBox strMessage 
     .Bookmark = varBookmark 
     End If 
     
     End With 
     
    End Sub 
     
    Sub FindMatch(rstTemp As Recordset, _ 
     strFind As String) 
     
     Dim varBookmark As Variant 
     Dim strMessage As String 
     
     With rstTemp 
     ' Store current record location. 
     varBookmark = .Bookmark 
     .FindFirst strFind 
     
     ' If Find method fails, notify user and return to the 
     ' last current record. 
     If .NoMatch Then 
     strMessage = _ 
     "Not found! Returning to current record." & _ 
     vbCr & vbCr & "NoMatch = " & .NoMatch 
     MsgBox strMessage 
     .Bookmark = varBookmark 
     End If 
     
     End With 
     
    End Sub
