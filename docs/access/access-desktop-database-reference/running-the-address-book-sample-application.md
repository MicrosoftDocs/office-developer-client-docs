# Running the Address Book Sample Application


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

To run the Address Book application, follow this procedure.

**To run this application**

1.  Make sure that Microsoft SQL Server is running. Click **Start**, point to **Programs**, point to **Microsoft SQL Server 7.0**, and then click **Service Manager**. If there is a green arrow in the white circle, then SQL Server is running. If it is not (there will be a red square in the white circle), click **Start/Continue**.

2.  In Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 or later, type the following address: **https://***webserver***/RDS/AddressBook/AddrBook.asp** where *webserver* is the name of the Web server where the RDS server components are installed.

3.  You can then try various scenarios in the Address Book sample application, such as searching for a person based on his or her e-mail name, listing all people with the title "Program Manager," or editing existing records. Click **Find** to fill the data grid with all the available names.
