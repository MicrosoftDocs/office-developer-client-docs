# OpenFunction Macro Action


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

In an Access project, you can use the **OpenFunction** action to open a user-defined function in Datasheet view, inline function Design view, SQL Text Editor view (for a scalar or table user-defined function), or Print Preview. This action runs the user-defined function when opened in Datasheet view. You can also select the data entry mode for the user-defined function and restrict the records that the user-defined function displays.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>This action will not be allowed if the database is not trusted. For more information about enabling macros, see the links in the See Also section of this article.</P>



## Setting

The **OpenFunction** action has the following arguments.

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><p>Action argument</p></th>
<th><p>Description</p></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>Function Name</strong></p></td>
<td><p>The name of the user-defined function to open. The <strong>Function Name</strong> box in the <strong>Action Arguments</strong> section of the Macro Builder pane shows all user-defined functions in the current database. This is a required argument.If you run a macro containing the <strong>Function</strong> action in a library database, Microsoft Access first looks for the function with this name in the library database, and then in the current database.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p><strong>View</strong></p></td>
<td><p>The view in which the user-defined function will open. Click <strong>Datasheet</strong>, <strong>Design</strong>, <strong>Print Preview</strong>, <strong>PivotTable</strong>, or <strong>PivotChart</strong> in the <strong>View</strong> box. The default is <strong>Datasheet</strong>.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>Data Mode</strong></p></td>
<td><p>The data entry mode for the user-defined function. This applies only to user-defined functions opened in Datasheet view. Click <strong>Add</strong> (the user can add new records but can't view or edit existing records), <strong>Edit</strong> (the user can view or edit existing records and add new records), or <strong>Read Only</strong> (the user can only view records). The default is <strong>Edit</strong>.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


## Remarks

This action is similar to double-clicking a user-defined function in the Navigation Pane, or right-clicking the function in the Navigation Pane and selecting a view.

Switching to Design view while the user-defined function is open removes the **Data Mode** argument setting for the user-defined function. This setting is not in effect, even if the user returns to Datasheet view.

**Tips**

  - You can select a user-defined function in the Navigation Pane and drag it to a macro action row. This automatically creates an **OpenFunction** action that opens the user-defined function in Datasheet view.

  - If you don't want to display the system messages that normally appear when a user-defined function is run (indicating it is a user-defined function and showing how many records will be affected), you can use the **SetWarning** action to suppress the display of these messages.

To run the **OpenFunction** action in a Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) module, use the **OpenFunction** method of the **DoCmd** object.
