# Visual Basic


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

In order to handle ADO events in Microsoft Visual Basic, you must declare a module-level variable using the **WithEvents** keyword. The variable can be declared only as part of a class module and must be declared at the module level. This is not as restrictive as it seems, however, because Visual Basic **Form** objects are also classes. The simplest way to handle ADO events is to declare a variable using **WithEvents**. The following example handles the **ConnectComplete** event for a **Connection** object:

``` 
 
' BeginEventExampleVB02 
Dim WithEvents connEvent As Connection 
Attribute connEvent.VB_VarHelpID = -1 
Dim strMsg As String 
 
Private Sub Form_Load() 
 On Error GoTo ErrHandler: 
 
 Dim strConn As String 
 
 ' Create a new object with event 
 ' handling enabled. 
 strConn = "Provider='sqloledb';" & _ 
 "Data Source='MySqlServer';" & _ 
 "Initial Catalog='Northwind';" & _ 
 "Integrated Security='SSPI';" 
 Set connEvent = New ADODB.Connection 
 connEvent.Open strConn 
 
 Exit Sub 
 
ErrHandler: 
 MsgBox strMsg 
End Sub 
 
Private Sub connEvent_ConnectComplete(ByVal pError As ADODB.Error, _ 
 adStatus As ADODB.EventStatusEnum, _ 
 ByVal pConnection As ADODB.Connection) 
 
 If adStatus = adStatusErrorsOccurred Then 
 If Not pError Is Nothing Then 
 Select Case pError.Number 
 Case adErrOperationCancelled 
 ' The operation was cancelled in the 
 ' Will event. Notify the user and exit. 
 strMsg = "I'm sorry you can't connect right now." & vbCrLf 
 strMsg = strMsg & " Click OK to exit." 
 Unload Me 
 Case Else 
 strMsg = "Error " & Format(pError.Number) & vbCrLf 
 strMsg = strMsg & pError.Description 
 strMsg = strMsg & " Click OK to exit." 
 Unload Me 
 End Select 
 Else 
 strMsg = "Error occured. Click OK to exit." 
 Unload Me 
 End If 
 End If 
 'frmWait.btnOK.Enabled = True 
End Sub 
' EndEventExampleVB02 
```

The **Connection** object is declared at the **Form** level using the **WithEvents** keyword to enable event handling. The Form\_Load event handler actually creates the object by assigning a new **Connection** object to *connEvent* and then opens the connection. Of course, a real application would do more processing in the Form\_Load event handler than is shown here.
