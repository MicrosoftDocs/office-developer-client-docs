# Using ADO with Scripting Languages


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

Within a scripting environment, ADO allows you to expose data by way of server-side scripting. In this scenario, ADO, the underlying OLE DB provider that it utilizes, and any other components needed to reference a given data store are installed on a server running Internet Information Services (IIS). Using Active Server Pages (ASP), ADO is a component referenced in a script that can generate HTML, for example. This HTML content can be passed via HTTP to a client Web browser. Through the use of scripting, the Web page can send actions back to the server-side script, allowing you to update, traverse, or view specific data.

## ODBC Data Sources

One notable difference between scripting and non-scripting ADO code is the ODBC Data Source, if used. For non-scripting applications, you can create a User DSN in the ODBC Data Source Administrator. For scripts that are running under IIS, you must create a System DSN; otherwise your scripts won't recognize the data source you created. This applies to any ADO scripting application using the Microsoft OLE DB Provider for ODBC through Microsoft IIS.
