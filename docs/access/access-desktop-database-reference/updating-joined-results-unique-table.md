## Updating JOINed Results: Unique Table

ADO enables you to closely control modifications to a particular base table in a **Recordset** that was formed by a JOIN operation on multiple base tables using the **Unique Table** dynamic property. For details on using **Unique Table**, refer to the ADO Programmer's Reference topics on the **Unique Table** and **Update Resynch** dynamic properties.
