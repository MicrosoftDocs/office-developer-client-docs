# Connection Object (DAO)


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013


> [!NOTE]
> <P>ODBCDirect workspaces are not supported in Microsoft Access 2013. Use ADO if you want to access external data sources without using the Microsoft Access database engine.</P>



A **Connection** object represents a connection to an ODBC database (ODBCDirect workspaces only).

## Remarks

A **Connection** is a non-persistent object that represents a connection to a remote database. The **Connection** object is only available in ODBCDirect workspaces (that is, a **Workspace** object created with the type option set to **dbUseODBC**).


> [!NOTE]
> <P>Code written for earlier versions of DAO can continue to use the <STRONG>Database</STRONG> object for backward compatibility, but if the new features of a <STRONG>Connection</STRONG> are desired, you should revise code to use the <STRONG>Connection</STRONG> object. To help with code conversion, you can obtain a <STRONG>Connection</STRONG> object reference from a <STRONG>Database</STRONG> by reading the <A href="database-connection-property-dao.md">Connection</A> property of the <STRONG>Database</STRONG> object. Conversely, you can obtain a <STRONG>Database</STRONG> object reference from the <STRONG>Connection</STRONG> object's <STRONG>Database</STRONG> property.</P>
