# ActiveCommand Property (ADO)


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

Indicates the [Command](command-object-ado.md) object that created the associated [Recordset](recordset-object-ado.md) object.

## Return Value

Returns a **Variant** that contains a **Command** object. Default is a null object reference.

## Remarks

The **ActiveCommand** property is read-only.

If a **Command** object was not used to create the current **Recordset**, then a **Null** object reference is returned.

Use this property to find the associated **Command** object when you are given only the resulting **Recordset** object.
