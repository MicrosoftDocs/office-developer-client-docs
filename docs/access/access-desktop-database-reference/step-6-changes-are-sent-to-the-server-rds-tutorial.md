# Step 6: Changes are Sent to the Server (RDS Tutorial)


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

If the **Recordset** object is edited, any changes (that is, rows that are added, changed, or deleted) can be sent back to the server.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>The default behavior of RDS can be invoked implicitly with ADO objects and the Microsoft OLE DB Remoting Provider. Queries can return <STRONG>Recordset</STRONG>s, and edited <STRONG>Recordset</STRONG>s can update the data source. This tutorial does not invoke RDS with ADO objects, but this is how it would look if it did:</P>



``` 
 
Dim rs as New ADODB.Recordset 
rs.Open "SELECT * FROM Authors","Provider=MS Remote;Data Source=Pubs;" & _ 
 "Remote Server=https://yourServer;Remote Provider=SQLOLEDB;" 
... ' Edit the Recordset. 
rs.UpdateBatch ' The equivalent of SubmitChanges. 
... 
```

**Part A**Assume for this case that you have only used the [RDS.DataControl](datacontrol-object-rds.md) and that a **Recordset** object is now associated with the **RDS.DataControl**. The [SubmitChanges](submitchanges-method-rds.md) method updates the data source with any changes to the **Recordset** object if the [Server](server-property-rds.md) and [Connect](connect-property-rds.md) properties are still set.

``` 
 
Sub RDSTutorial6A() 
Dim DC as New RDS.DataControl 
Dim RS as ADODB.Recordset 
DC.Server = "https://yourServer" 
DC.Connect = "DSN=Pubs" 
DC.SQL = "SELECT * FROM Authors" 
DC.Refresh 
... 
Set RS = DC.Recordset 
 ' Edit the Recordset. 
... 
DC.SubmitChanges 
... 
```

**Part B**Alternatively, you could update the server with the [RDSServer.DataFactory](datafactory-object-rdsserver.md) object, specifying a connection and a **Recordset** object.

``` 
 
Sub RDSTutorial6B() 
Dim DS As New RDS.DataSpace 
Dim RS As ADODB.Recordset 
Dim DC As New RDS.DataControl 
Dim DF As Object 
Dim blnStatus As Boolean 
Set DF = DS.CreateObject("RDSServer.DataFactory", "https://yourServer") 
Set RS = DF.Query ("DSN=Pubs", "SELECT * FROM Authors") 
DC.SourceRecordset = RS ' Visual controls can now bind to DC. 
 ' Edit the Recordset. 
blnStatus = DF.SubmitChanges "DSN=Pubs", RS 
End Sub 
```

**This is the end of the tutorial.**
