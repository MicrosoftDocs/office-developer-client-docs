# Streams and Persistence


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

**In this article**  
Scenario 1  
Scenario 2  
Scenario 3  
Scenario 4  

The [Recordset](recordset-object-ado.md) object [Save](save-method-ado.md) method stores, or *persists*, a **Recordset** in a file, and the [Open](open-method-ado-recordset.md) method restores the **Recordset** from that file.

With ADO 2.5, the **Save** and **Open** methods can persist a **Recordset** to a [Stream](stream-object-ado.md) object as well. This feature is especially useful when working with Remote Data Service (RDS) and Active Server Pages (ASP).

For more information about how persistence can be used by itself on ASP pages, see the current ASP documentation.

The following are a few scenarios that show how **Stream** objects and persistence can be used.

## Scenario 1

This scenario simply saves a **Recordset** to a file and then to a **Stream**. It then opens the persisted stream into another **Recordset**.

``` 
 
Dim rs1 As ADODB.Recordset 
Dim rs2 As ADODB.Recordset 
Dim stm As ADODB.Stream 
 
Set rs1 = New ADODB.Recordset 
Set rs2 = New ADODB.Recordset 
Set stm = New ADODB.Stream 
 
rs1.Open "SELECT * FROM Customers", "Provider=sqloledb;" & _ 
 "Data Source=MyServer;Initial Catalog=Northwind;" & _ 
 "Integrated Security=SSPI;""", adopenStatic, adLockReadOnly, adCmdText 
rs1.Save "c:\myfolder\mysubfolder\myrs.xml", adPersistXML 
rs1.Save stm, adPersistXML 
rs2.Open stm 
```

## Scenario 2

This scenario persists a **Recordset** into a **Stream** in XML format. It then reads the **Stream** into a string that you can examine, manipulate, or display.

``` 
 
Dim rs As ADODB.Recordset 
Dim stm As ADODB.Stream 
Dim strRst As String 
 
Set rs = New ADODB.Recordset 
Set stm = New ADODB.Stream 
 
' Open, save, and close the recordset. 
rs.Open "SELECT * FROM Customers", "Provider=sqloledb;" & _ 
 "Data Source=MyServer;Initial Catalog=Northwind;" & _ 
 "Integrated Security=SSPI;""" 
rs.Save stm, adPersistXML 
rs.Close 
Set rs = nothing 
 
' Put saved Recordset into a string variable. 
strRst = stm.ReadText(adReadAll) 
 
' Examine, manipulate, or display the XML data. 
... 
```

## Scenario 3

This example code shows ASP code persisting a **Recordset** as XML directly to the **Response** object:

``` 
 
... 
<% 
response.ContentType = "text/xml" 
 
' Create and open a Recordset. 
Set rs = Server.CreateObject("ADODB.Recordset") 
rs.Open "select * from Customers", "Provider=sqloledb;" & _ 
 "Data Source=MyServer;Initial Catalog=Northwind;" & _ 
 "Integrated Security=SSPI;""" 
 
' Save Recordset directly into output stream. 
rs.Save Response, adPersistXML 
 
' Close Recordset. 
rs.Close 
Set rs = nothing 
%> 
... 
```

## Scenario 4

In this scenario, ASP code writes the contents of the **Recordset** in ADTG format to the client. The [Microsoft Cursor Service for OLE DB](microsoft-cursor-service-for-ole-db-ado-service-component.md) can use this data to create a disconnected **Recordset**.

A new property on the RDS [DataControl](datacontrol-object-rds.md), [URL](url-property-rds.md), points to the .asp page that generates the **Recordset**. This means a **Recordset** object can be obtained without RDS using the server-side [DataFactory](datafactory-object-rdsserver.md) object or the user writing a business object. This simplifies the RDS programming model significantly.

Server-side code, named https://server/directory/recordset.asp:

``` 
 
<% 
Dim rs 
Set rs = Server.CreateObject("ADODB.Recordset") 
rs.Open "select au_fname, au_lname, phone from Authors", ""& _ 
 "Provider=sqloledb;Data Source=MyServer;" & _ 
 "Initial Catalog=Pubs;Integrated Security=SSPI;" 
response.ContentType = "multipart/mixed" 
rs.Save response, adPersistADTG 
%> 
```

Client-side code:

``` 
 
<HTML> 
<HEAD> 
<TITLE>RDS Query Page</TITLE> 
</HEAD> 
<body> 
<CENTER> 
<H1>Remote Data Service 2.5</H1> 
<TABLE DATASRC="#DC1"> 
 <TR> 
 <TD><SPAN DATAFLD="au_fname"></SPAN></TD> 
 <TD><SPAN DATAFLD="au_lname"></SPAN></TD> 
 <TD><SPAN DATAFLD="phone"></SPAN></TD> 
 </TR> 
</TABLE> 

<BR> 
 
<OBJECT classid="clsid:BD96C556-65A3-11D0-983A-00C04FC29E33" 
 ID=DC1 HEIGHT=1 WIDTH = 1> 
 <PARAM NAME="URL" VALUE="https://server/directory/recordset.asp"> 
</OBJECT> 
 
</SCRIPT> 
</BODY> 
</HTML> 
```

Developers also have the option of using a **Recordset** object on the client:

``` 
 
... 
function GetRs() 
 { 
 rs = CreateObject("ADODB.Recordset"); 
 rs.Open "https://server/directory/recordset.asp" 
 DC1.SourceRecordset = rs; 
 } 
... 
```
