# MarshalOptions Property (ADO)


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

Indicates which records are to be marshaled back to the server.

## Settings And Return Values

Sets or returns a [MarshalOptionsEnum](marshaloptionsenum.md) value. The default value is **adMarshalAll**.

## Remarks

When using a client-side [Recordset](recordset-object-ado.md), records that have been modified on the client are written back to the middle tier or Web server through a technique called marshaling, the process of packaging and sending interface method parameters across thread or process boundaries. Setting the **MarshalOptions** property can improve performance when modified remote data is marshaled for updating back to the middle tier or Web server.

**Remote Data Service Usage**This property is used only on a client-side **Recordset**.
