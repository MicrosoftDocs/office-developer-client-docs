# Ordinal Property (ADO MD Cell)


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

Uniquely identifies a cell by its position within a cellset.

## Return Values

Returns a **Long** integer and is read-only.

## Remarks

The cell's ordinal value uniquely identifies the cell within a cellset. Conceptually, cells are numbered in a cellset as if the cellset were a *p*-dimensional array, where *p* is the number of [axes](axes-collection-ado-md.md). Cells are numbered starting from zero in row-major order.

The cell's ordinal value can be used with the [Item](item-property-ado-md-cellset.md) property of the [Cellset](cellset-object-ado-md.md) object to quickly retrieve the [Cell](cell-object-ado-md.md).
