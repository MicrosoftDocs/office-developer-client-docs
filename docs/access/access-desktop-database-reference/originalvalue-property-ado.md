# OriginalValue Property (ADO)


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

**In this article**  
Return Value  
Remarks  
Record  

Indicates the value of a [Field](field-object-ado.md) that existed in the record before any changes were made.

## Return Value

Returns a **Variant** value that represents the value of a field prior to any change.

## Remarks

Use the **OriginalValue** property to return the original field value for a field from the current record.

In *immediate update mode* (in which the provider writes changes to the underlying data source after you call the [Update](update-method-ado.md) method), the **OriginalValue** property returns the field value that existed prior to any changes (that is, since the last **Update** method call). This is the same value that the [CancelUpdate](cancelupdate-method-ado.md) method uses to replace the [Value](value-property-ado.md) property.

In *batch update mode* (in which the provider caches multiple changes and writes them to the underlying data source only when you call the [UpdateBatch](updatebatch-method-ado.md) method), the **OriginalValue** property returns the field value that existed prior to any changes (that is, since the last **UpdateBatch** method call). This is the same value that the [CancelBatch](cancelbatch-method-ado.md) method uses to replace the **Value** property. When you use this property with the [UnderlyingValue](underlyingvalue-property-ado.md) property, you can resolve conflicts that arise from batch updates.

## Record

For [Record](record-object-ado.md) objects, the **OriginalValue** property will be empty for fields added before [Update](update-method-ado.md) is called.
