# DateCreated Property (ADOX)


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

Indicates the date the object was created.

## Return Values

Returns a **Variant** value specifying the date created. The value is null if **DateCreated** is not supported by the provider.

## Remarks

The **DateCreated** property is null for newly appended objects. After appending a new [View](view-object-adox.md) or [Procedure](procedure-object-adox.md), you must call the [Refresh](refresh-method-ado.md) method of the [Views](views-collection-adox.md) or [Procedures](procedures-collection-adox.md) collection to obtain values for the **DateCreated** property.
