# Step 2: Initialize the Main List Box


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

## Step 2: Initialize the Main List Box

**To declare global Record and Recordset objects**

  - Insert the following code into the (General) (Declarations) for Form1:
    
    ``` 
     
    Option Explicit 
    Dim grec As Record 
    Dim grs As Recordset 
    ```
    
    This code declares global object references for **Record** and **Recordset** objects that will be used later in this scenario.

**To connect to a URL and populate lstMain**

  - Insert the following code into the Form Load event handler for Form1:
    
    ``` 
     
    Private Sub Form_Load() 
        Set grec = New Record 
        Set grs = New Recordset 
        grec.Open "", "URL=https://servername/foldername/", , _ 
            adOpenIfExists Or adCreateCollection 
        Set grs = grec.GetChildren 
        While Not grs.EOF 
            lstMain.AddItem grs(0) 
            grs.MoveNext 
        Wend 
    End Sub 
    ```
    
    This code instantiates the global **Record** and **Recordset** objects. The **Record**, grec, is opened with a URL specified as the **ActiveConnection**. If the URL exists, it is opened; if it does not already exist, it is created. Note that you should replace "https://servername/foldername/" with a valid URL from your environment. The **Recordset**, grs, is opened on the children of the **Record**, grec. Then lstMain is populated with the file names of the resources published to the URL.
