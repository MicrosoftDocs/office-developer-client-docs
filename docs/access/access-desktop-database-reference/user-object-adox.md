# User Object (ADOX)


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

Represents a user account that has access permissions within a secured database.

## Remarks

The [Users](users-collection-adox.md) collection of a [Catalog](catalog-object-adox.md) represents all the catalog's users. The **Users** collection for a [Group](group-object-adox.md) represents only the users of the specific group.

With the properties, collections, and methods of a **User** object, you can:

  - Identify the user with the [Name](name-property-adox.md) property.

  - Change the password for a user with the [ChangePassword](changepassword-method-adox.md) method.

  - Determine whether a user has read, write, or delete permissions with the [GetPermissions](getpermissions-method-adox.md) and [SetPermissions](setpermissions-method-adox.md) methods.

  - Access the groups to which a user belongs with the [Groups](groups-collection-adox.md) collection.

  - Access provider-specific properties with the [Properties](properties-collection-ado.md) collection.
