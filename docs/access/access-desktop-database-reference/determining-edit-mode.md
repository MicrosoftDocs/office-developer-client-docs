# Determining Edit Mode


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

ADO maintains an editing buffer associated with the current record. The **EditMode** property indicates whether changes have been made to this buffer or whether a new record has been created. Use **EditMode** to determine the editing status of the current record. You can test for pending changes if an editing process has been interrupted and determine whether you need to use the **Update** or **CancelUpdate** method.

**EditMode** returns one of the **EditModeEnum** constants, which are listed in the following table.

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><p>Constant</p></th>
<th><p>Description</p></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>adEditNone</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Indicates that no editing operation is in progress.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p><strong>adEditInProgress</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Indicates that data in the current record has been modified but not saved.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>adEditAdd</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Indicates that the <strong>AddNew</strong> method has been called, and the current record in the copy buffer is a new record that has not been saved to the database.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p><strong>adEditDelete</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Indicates that the current record has been deleted.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


**EditMode** can return a valid value only if there is a current record. **EditMode** will return an error if **BOF** or **EOF** is **True** or if the current record has been deleted.
