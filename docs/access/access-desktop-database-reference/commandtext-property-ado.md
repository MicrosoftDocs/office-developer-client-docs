# CommandText Property (ADO)


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

Indicates the text of a command to be issued against a provider.

## Settings and Return Values

Sets or returns a **String** value that contains a provider command, such as an SQL statement, a table name, a relative URL, or a stored procedure call. Default is "" (zero-length string).

## Remarks

Use the **CommandText** property to set or return the text of a command represented by a [Command](command-object-ado.md) object. Usually this will be an SQL statement, but can also be any other type of command statement recognized by the provider, such as a stored procedure call. An SQL statement must be of the particular dialect or version supported by the provider's query processor.

If the [Prepared](prepared-property-ado.md) property of the **Command** object is set to **True** and the **Command** object is bound to an open connection when you set the **CommandText** property, ADO prepares the query (that is, a compiled form of the query that is stored by the provider) when you call the [Execute](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/jj248785\(v=office.15\)) or **Open** methods.

Depending on the [CommandType](commandtype-property-ado.md) property setting, ADO may alter the **CommandText** property. You can read the **CommandText** property at any time to see the actual command text that ADO will use during execution.

Use the **CommandText** property to set or return a relative URL that specifies a resource, such as a file or directory. The resource is relative to a location specified explicitly by an absolute URL, or implicitly by an open [Connection](connection-object-ado.md) object.
