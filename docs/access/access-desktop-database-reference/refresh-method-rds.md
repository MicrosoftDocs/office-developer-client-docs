# Refresh Method (RDS)


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

**In this article**  
Syntax  
Parameters  
Remarks  

Requeries the data source specified in the [Connect](connect-property-rds.md) property and updates the query results.

## Syntax

*DataControl*.Refresh

## Parameters

  - *DataControl*

  - An object variable that represents an [RDS.DataControl](datacontrol-object-rds.md) object.

## Remarks

You must set the [Connect](connect-property-rds.md), [Server](server-property-rds.md), and [SQL](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/jj248989\(v=office.15\)) properties before you use the **Refresh** method. All data-bound controls on the form associated with an **RDS.DataControl** object will reflect the new set of records. Any pre-existing [Recordset](recordset-object-ado.md) object is released, and any unsaved changes are discarded. The **Refresh** method automatically makes the first record the current record.

It's a good idea to call the **Refresh** method periodically when you work with data. If you retrieve data, and then leave it on your client machine for a while, it is likely to become out of date. It's possible that any changes you make will fail, because someone else might have changed the record and submitted changes before you.
