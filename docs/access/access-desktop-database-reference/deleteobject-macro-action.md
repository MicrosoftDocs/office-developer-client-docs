# DeleteObject Macro Action


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

You can use the **DeleteObject** action to delete a specified database object.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>This action will not be allowed if the database is not trusted. For more information about enabling macros, see the links in the See Also section of this article.</P>



## Setting

The **DeleteObject** action has the following arguments.

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><p>Action argument</p></th>
<th><p>Description</p></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>Object Type</strong></p></td>
<td><p>The type of object to delete. Click <strong>Table</strong>, <strong>Query</strong>, <strong>Form</strong>, <strong>Report</strong>, <strong>Macro</strong>, <strong>Module</strong>, <strong>Data Access Page</strong>, <strong>Server View</strong>, <strong>Diagram</strong>, <strong>Stored Procedure</strong>, or <strong>Function</strong> in the <strong>Object Type</strong> box in the <strong>Action Arguments</strong> section of the Macro Builder pane. To delete the object selected in the Navigation Pane, leave this argument blank.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p><strong>Object Name</strong></p></td>
<td><p>The name of the object to delete. The <strong>Object Name</strong> box shows all objects in the database of the type selected by the <strong>Object Type</strong> argument. If you leave the <strong>Object Type</strong> box blank, leave this box blank also. If you run a macro containing the <strong>DeleteObject</strong> action in a library database, Microsoft Office Access 2007 first looks for the object with this name in the library database, and then in the current database.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>



> [!WARNING]
> <P>If you leave the <STRONG>Object Type</STRONG> and <STRONG>Object Name</STRONG> boxes blank, Access deletes the object selected in the Navigation Pane without displaying a warning message when it encounters the <STRONG>DeleteObject</STRONG> action.</P>



## Remarks

You can use the **DeleteObject** action to delete temporary objects you have created while running the macro. For example, you could use the **OpenQuery** action to run a make-table query that creates a temporary table. When you are finished using the temporary table, you can use the **DeleteObject** action to delete it.

This action has the same effect as selecting an object in the Navigation Pane and then pressing the DEL key, or right-clicking the object in the Navigation Pane and clicking **Delete**.

To run the **DeleteObject** action in a Visual Basic for Applications module, you can use the **DeleteObject** method of the **DoCmd** object.
