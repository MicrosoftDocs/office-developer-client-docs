# Recordset2.Cancel Method (DAO)


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

## Syntax

*expression* .Cancel

*expression* An expression that returns a **Recordset2** object.

## Remarks

Use the **Cancel** method to terminate execution of an asynchronous **Execute** or **OpenConnection** method call (that is, the method was invoked with the dbRunAsync option). **Cancel** will return a run-time error if dbRunAsync was not used in the method you're trying to terminate.
