# Microsoft Data Shaping Service for OLE DB (ADO Service Provider)


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

The Microsoft Data Shaping Service for OLE DB service provider supports the construction of hierarchical (shaped) [Recordset](recordset-object-ado.md) objects from a data provider.

## Provider Keyword

To invoke the Data Shaping Service for OLE DB, specify the following keyword and value in the connection string.

``` 
 
"Provider=MSDataShape" 
```

## Dynamic Properties

When this service provider is invoked, the following dynamic properties are added to the [Connection](connection-object-ado.md) object's [Properties](properties-collection-ado.md) collection.

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><p>Dynamic Property Name</p></th>
<th><p>Description</p></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>Unique Reshape Names</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Indicates whether <strong>Recordset</strong> objects with duplicate values for their <strong>Reshape Name</strong> properties are allowed. If this dynamic property is <strong>True</strong> and a new <strong>Recordset</strong> is created with the same user-specified reshape name as an existing <strong>Recordset</strong>, then the new <strong>Recordset</strong> object's reshape name is modified to make it unique. If this property is <strong>False</strong> and a new <strong>Recordset</strong> is created with the same user-specified reshape name as the existing <strong>Recordset</strong>, both <strong>Recordset</strong> objects will have the same reshape name. Therefore, neither <strong>Recordset</strong> can be reshaped as long as both recordsets exist. The default value of the property is <strong>False</strong>.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p><strong>Data Provider</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Indicates the name of the provider that will supply rows to be shaped. This value may be NONE if a provider will not be used to supply rows.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


You may also set writable dynamic properties by specifying their names as keywords in the connection string. For example, in Microsoft Visual Basic, set the **Data Provider** dynamic property to "MSDASQL" by specifying:

``` 
 
Dim cn as New ADODB.Connection 
cn.Open "Provider=MSDataShape;Data Provider=MSDASQL" 
```

You may also set or retrieve a dynamic property by specifying its name as the index to the [Properties](properties-collection-ado.md) property. For example, get and print the current value of the **Data Provider** dynamic property, then set a new value, like this:

``` 
 
Debug.Print cn.Properties("Data Provider") 
cn.Properties("Data Provider") = "MSDASQL" 
```
