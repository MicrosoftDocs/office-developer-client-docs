# Close Method (ADO)


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

Closes an open object and any dependent objects.

## Syntax

*object*.Close

## Remarks

Use the **Close** method to close a [Connection](connection-object-ado.md), a [Record](record-object-ado.md), a [Recordset](recordset-object-ado.md), or a [Stream](stream-object-ado.md) object to free any associated system resources. Closing an object does not remove it from memory; you can change its property settings and open it again later. To completely eliminate an object from memory, set the object variable to *Nothing* (in Visual Basic) after closing the object.

**Connection**

Using the **Close** method to close a **Connection** object also closes any active **Recordset** objects associated with the connection. A [Command](command-object-ado.md) object associated with the **Connection** object you are closing will persist, but it will no longer be associated with a **Connection** object; that is, its [ActiveConnection](activeconnection-property-ado.md) property will be set to **Nothing**. Also, the **Command** object's [Parameters](parameters-collection-ado.md) collection will be cleared of any provider-defined parameters.

You can later call the [Open](open-method-ado-connection.md) method to re-establish the connection to the same, or another, data source. While the **Connection** object is closed, calling any methods that require an open connection to the data source generates an error.

Closing a **Connection** object while there are open **Recordset** objects on the connection rolls back any pending changes in all of the **Recordset** objects. Explicitly closing a **Connection** object (calling the **Close** method) while a transaction is in progress generates an error. If a **Connection** object falls out of scope while a transaction is in progress, ADO automatically rolls back the transaction.

**Recordset, Record, Stream**

Using the **Close** method to close a **Recordset**, **Record**, or **Stream** object releases the associated data and any exclusive access you may have had to the data through this particular object. You can later call the [Open](open-method-ado-recordset.md) method to reopen the object with the same, or modified, attributes.

While a **Recordset** object is closed, calling any methods that require a live cursor generates an error.

If an edit is in progress while in immediate update mode, calling the **Close** method generates an error; instead, call the [Update](update-method-ado.md) or [CancelUpdate](cancelupdate-method-ado.md) method first. If you close the **Recordset** object while in batch update mode, all changes since the last [UpdateBatch](updatebatch-method-ado.md) call are lost.

If you use the [Clone](clone-method-ado.md) method to create copies of an open **Recordset** object, closing the original or a clone does not affect any of the other copies.
