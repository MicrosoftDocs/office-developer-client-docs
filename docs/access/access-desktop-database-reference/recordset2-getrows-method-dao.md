# Recordset2.GetRows Method (DAO)


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

**In this article**  
Syntax  
Remarks  
Example  

Retrieves multiple rows from a **[Recordset](recordset-object-dao.md)** object.

## Syntax

*expression* .GetRows(***NumRows***)

*expression* A variable that represents a **Recordset2** object.

### Parameters

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 25%" />
<col style="width: 25%" />
<col style="width: 25%" />
<col style="width: 25%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><p>Name</p></th>
<th><p>Required/Optional</p></th>
<th><p>Data Type</p></th>
<th><p>Description</p></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>NumRows</p></td>
<td><p>Optional</p></td>
<td><p><strong>Variant</strong></p></td>
<td><p>The number of rows to retrieve.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


### Return Value

Variant

## Remarks

Use the **GetRows** method to copy records from a **Recordset**. **GetRows** returns a two-dimensional array. The first subscript identifies the field and the second identifies the row number. For example, intField represents the field, and intRecord identifies the row number:

avarRecords(intField, intRecord)

To get the first field value in the second row returned, use code like the following:

field1 = avarRecords(0,1)

To get the second field value in the first row, use code like the following:

field2 = avarRecords(1,0)

The avarRecords variable automatically becomes a two-dimensional array when **GetRows** returns data.

If you request more rows than are available, then **GetRows** returns only the number of available rows. You can use the Visual Basic for Applications **UBound** function to determine how many rows **GetRows** actually retrieved, because the array is sized to fit the number of returned rows. For example, if you returned the results into a **Variant** called varA, you could use the following code to determine how many rows were actually returned:

numReturned = UBound(varA,2) + 1

You need to use "+ 1" because the first row returned is in the 0 element of the array. The number of rows that you can retrieve is constrained by the amount of available memory. You shouldn't use **GetRows** to retrieve an entire table into an array if it is large.

Because **GetRows** returns all fields of the **Recordset** into the array, including Memo and Long Binary fields, you might want to use a query that restricts the fields returned.

After you call **GetRows**, the current record is positioned at the next unread row. That is, **GetRows** has the same effect on the current record as **Move**numrows.

If you are trying to retrieve all the rows by using multiple **GetRows** calls, use the **[EOF](recordset2-eof-property-dao.md)** property to be sure that you're at the end of the **Recordset**. **GetRows** returns less than the number requested if it's at the end of the **Recordset**, or if it can't retrieve a row in the range requested. For example, if you're trying to retrieve 10 records, but you can't retrieve the fifth record, **GetRows** returns four records and makes the fifth record the current record. This will not generate a run-time error. This might occur if another user deletes a record in a dynaset-type **Recordset**. See the example for a demonstration of how to handle this.

## Example

This example uses the **GetRows** method to retrieve a specified number of rows from a **Recordset** and to fill an array with the resulting data. The **GetRows** method will return fewer than the desired number of rows in two cases: either if **EOF** has been reached, or if **GetRows** tried to retrieve a record that was deleted by another user. The function returns **False** only if the second case occurs. The GetRowsOK function is required for this procedure to run.
