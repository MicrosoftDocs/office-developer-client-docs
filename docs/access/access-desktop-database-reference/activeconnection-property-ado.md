# ActiveConnection Property (ADO)


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

Indicates to which [Connection](connection-object-ado.md) object the specified [Command](command-object-ado.md), [Recordset](recordset-object-ado.md), or [Record](record-object-ado.md) object currently belongs.

## Settings and Return Values

Sets or returns a **String** value that contains a definition for a connection if the connection is closed, or a **Variant** containing the current **Connection** object if the connection is open. Default is a null object reference. See the [ConnectionString](connectionstring-property-ado.md) property.

## Remarks

Use the **ActiveConnection** property to determine the **Connection** object over which the specified **Command** object will execute or the specified **Recordset** will be opened.

**Command**

For **Command** objects, the **ActiveConnection** property is read/write.

If you attempt to call the [Execute](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/jj248785\(v=office.15\)) method on a **Command** object before setting this property to an open **Connection** object or valid connection string, an error occurs.

**Microsoft Visual Basic**Setting the **ActiveConnection** property to *Nothing* disassociates the **Command** object from the current **Connection** and causes the provider to release any associated resources on the data source. You can then associate the **Command** object with the same or another **Connection** object. Some providers allow you to change the property setting from one **Connection** to another, without having to first set the property to *Nothing*.

If the [Parameters](parameters-collection-ado.md) collection of the **Command** object contains parameters supplied by the provider, the collection is cleared if you set the **ActiveConnection** property to *Nothing* or to another **Connection** object. If you manually create [Parameter](parameter-object-ado.md) objects and use them to fill the **Parameters** collection of the **Command** object, setting the **ActiveConnection** property to *Nothing* or to another **Connection** object leaves the **Parameters** collection intact.

Closing the **Connection** object with which a **Command** object is associated sets the **ActiveConnection** property to *Nothing*. Setting this property to a closed **Connection** object generates an error.

**Recordset**

For open **Recordset** objects or for **Recordset** objects whose [Source](source-property-ado-recordset.md) property is set to a valid **Command** object, the **ActiveConnection** property is read-only. Otherwise, it is read/write.

You can set this property to a valid **Connection** object or to a valid connection string. In this case, the provider creates a new **Connection** object using this definition and opens the connection. Additionally, the provider may set this property to the new **Connection** object to give you a way to access the **Connection** object for extended error information or to execute other commands.

If you use the *ActiveConnection* argument of the [Open](open-method-ado-recordset.md) method to open a **Recordset** object, the **ActiveConnection** property will inherit the value of the argument.

If you set the **Source** property of the **Recordset** object to a valid **Command** object variable, the **ActiveConnection** property of the **Recordset** inherits the setting of the **Command** object's **ActiveConnection** property.

**Remote Data Service Usage**When used on a client-side Recordset object, this property can be set only to a connection string or (in Microsoft Visual Basic or Visual Basic, Scripting Edition) to *Nothing*.

**Record**

This property is read/write when the **Record** object is closed, and may contain a connection string or reference to an open **Connection** object. This property is read-only when the **Record** object is open, and contains a reference to an open **Connection** object.

A **Connection** object is created implicitly when the **Record** object is opened from a URL. Open the **Record** with an existing, open **Connection** object by assigning the **Connection** object to this property, or using the **Connection** object as a parameter in the [Open](open-method-ado-record.md) method call. If the **Record** is opened from an existing **Record** or [Recordset](recordset-object-ado.md), then it is automatically associated with that **Record** or **Recordset** object's **Connection** object.
