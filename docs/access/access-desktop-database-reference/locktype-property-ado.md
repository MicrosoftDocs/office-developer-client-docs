# LockType Property (ADO)


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

Indicates the type of locks placed on records during editing.

## Settings and Return Values

Sets or returns a [LockTypeEnum](locktypeenum.md) value. The default value is **adLockReadOnly**.

## Remarks

Set the **LockType** property before opening a [Recordset](recordset-object-ado.md) to specify what type of locking the provider should use when opening it. Read the property to return the type of locking in use on an open **Recordset** object.

Providers may not support all lock types. If a provider cannot support the requested **LockType** setting, it will substitute another type of locking. To determine the actual locking functionality available in a **Recordset** object, use the [Supports](supports-method-ado.md) method with **adUpdate** and **adUpdateBatch**.

The **adLockPessimistic** setting is not supported if the [CursorLocation](cursorlocation-property-ado.md) property is set to **adUseClient**. If an unsupported value is set, then no error will result; the closest supported **LockType** will be used instead.

The **LockType** property is read/write when the **Recordset** is closed and read-only when it is open.

**Remote Data Service Usage**When used on a client-side Recordset object, the **LockType** property can only be set to **adLockBatchOptimistic**.
