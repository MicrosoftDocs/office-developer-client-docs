# Chapter 8: Understanding Cursors and Locks


_**Applies to:** Access 2013 | Office 2013_

It is important to understand how cursors operate so you can select the best and most efficient cursor type for an application's data-access requirements. A less-than-optimal cursor configuration can make data-access operations painfully slow.

Many capabilities of the ADO **Recordset** object are determined by the type and location of the cursor, as well as the lock type.

This chapter covers the following topics:

  - [What is a Cursor?](what-is-a-cursor.md)

  - [Types of Cursors](types-of-cursors.md)

  - [The Significance of Cursor Location](the-significance-of-cursor-location.md)

  - [The Microsoft Cursor Service for OLE DB](the-microsoft-cursor-service-for-ole-db.md)

  - [What is a Lock?](what-is-a-lock.md)

  - [Using CacheSize](using-cachesize.md)

  - [Cursor and Lock Characteristics](cursor-and-lock-characteristics.md)
