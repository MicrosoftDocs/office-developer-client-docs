# Close Method (ADO MD)


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

Closes an open cellset.

## Syntax

*Cellset*.Close

## Remarks

Using the **Close** method to close a [Cellset](cellset-object-ado-md.md) object will release the associated data, including data in any related [Cell](cell-object-ado-md.md), [Axis](axis-object-ado-md.md), [Position](position-object-ado-md.md), or [Member](member-object-ado-md.md) objects. Closing a **Cellset** does not remove it from memory; you can change its property settings and open it again later. To completely eliminate an object from memory, set the object variable to **Nothing**.

You can later call the [Open](open-method-ado-md.md) method to reopen the **Cellset** using the same or another source string. While the **Cellset** object is closed, retrieving any properties or calling any methods that reference the underlying data or metadata generates an error.
