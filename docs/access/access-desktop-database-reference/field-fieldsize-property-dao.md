# Field.FieldSize Property (DAO)


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

**In this article**  
Syntax  
Remarks  
Example  

Returns the number of bytes used in the database (rather than in memory) of a Memo or Long Binary **[Field](field-object-dao.md)** object in the **[Fields](fields-collection-dao.md)** collection of a **[Recordset](recordset-object-dao.md)** object.

## Syntax

*expression* .FieldSize

*expression* A variable that represents a **Field** object.

## Remarks

You can use **FieldSize** with the **[AppendChunk](field-appendchunk-method-dao.md)** and **[GetChunk](field-getchunk-method-dao.md)** methods to manipulate large fields.

Because the size of a Long Binary or Memo field can exceed 64K, you should assign the value returned by **FieldSize** to a variable large enough to store a **Long** variable.

To determine the size of a **Field** object other than Memo and Long Binary types, use the **[Size](field-size-property-dao.md)** property.

  - If the database server or ODBC driver does not support server-side cursors.

  - If you are using the ODBC cursor library (that is, the **DefaultCursorDriver** property is set to **dbUseODBC**, or to **dbUseDefault** when the server does not support server-side cursors).

  - If you are using a cursorless query (that is, the **DefaultCursorDriver** property is set to **dbUseNoCursor**).

The **FieldSize** property and the VBA **Len()** or **LenB()** functions may return different values as the length of the same string. Strings are stored in a Microsoft Access database in multi-byte character set (MBCS) form, but exposed through VBA in Unicode format. As a result, the **Len()** function will always return the number of characters, **LenB** will always return the number of characters X 2 (Unicode uses two bytes for each character), but **FieldSize** will return some value in between if the string has any MBCS characters. For example, given a string consisting of three normal characters and two MBCS characters, **Len()** will return 5, **LenB()** will return 10, and **FieldSize** will return 7, the sum of 1 for each normal character and 2 for each MBCS character.

## Example

This example uses the **FieldSize** property to list the number of bytes used by the Memo and Long Binary Field objects in two different tables.

    Sub FieldSizeX() 
     
     Dim dbsNorthwind As Database 
     Dim rstCategories As Recordset 
     Dim rstEmployees As Recordset 
     
     Set dbsNorthwind = OpenDatabase("Northwind.mdb") 
     Set rstCategories = _ 
     dbsNorthwind.OpenRecordset("Categories", _ 
     dbOpenDynaset) 
     Set rstEmployees = _ 
     dbsNorthwind.OpenRecordset("Employees", _ 
     dbOpenDynaset) 
     
     Debug.Print _ 
     "Field sizes from records in Categories table" 
     
     With rstCategories 
     Debug.Print " CategoryName - " & _ 
     "Description (bytes) - Picture (bytes)" 
     
     ' Enumerate the Categories Recordset and print the size 
     ' in bytes of the picture field for each record. 
     Do While Not .EOF 
     Debug.Print " " & !CategoryName & " - " & _ 
     !Description.FieldSize & " - " & _ 
     !Picture.FieldSize 
     .MoveNext 
     Loop 
     
     .Close 
     End With 
     
     Debug.Print "Field sizes from records in Employees table" 
     
     With rstEmployees 
     Debug.Print " LastName - Notes (bytes) - " & _ 
     "Photo (bytes)" 
     
     ' Enumerate the Employees Recordset and print the size 
     ' in bytes of the picture field for each record. 
     Do While Not .EOF 
     Debug.Print " " & !LastName & " - " & _ 
     !Notes.FieldSize & " - " & !Photo.FieldSize 
     .MoveNext 
     Loop 
     
     .Close 
     End With 
     
     dbsNorthwind.Close 
     
    End Sub 

This example uses the **AppendChunk** and **GetChunk** methods to fill an OLE object field with data from another record, 32K at a time. In a real application, one might use a procedure like this to copy an employee record (including the employee's photo) from one table to another. In this example, the record is simply being copied back to same table. Note that all the chunk manipulation takes place within a single AddNew-Update sequence.

    Sub AppendChunkX() 
     
     Dim dbsNorthwind As Database 
     Dim rstEmployees As Recordset 
     Dim rstEmployees2 As Recordset 
     
     Set dbsNorthwind = OpenDatabase("Northwind.mdb") 
     
     ' Open two recordsets from the Employees table. 
     Set rstEmployees = _ 
     dbsNorthwind.OpenRecordset("Employees", _ 
     dbOpenDynaset) 
     Set rstEmployees2 = rstEmployees.Clone 
     
     ' Add a new record to the first Recordset and copy the 
     ' data from a record in the second Recordset. 
     With rstEmployees 
     .AddNew 
     !FirstName = rstEmployees2!FirstName 
     !LastName = rstEmployees2!LastName 
     CopyLargeField rstEmployees2!Photo, !Photo 
     .Update 
     
     ' Delete new record because this is a demonstration. 
     .Bookmark = .LastModified 
     .Delete 
     .Close 
     End With 
     
     rstEmployees2.Close 
     dbsNorthwind.Close 
     
    End Sub 
     
    Function CopyLargeField(fldSource As Field, _ 
     fldDestination As Field) 
     
     ' Set size of chunk in bytes. 
     Const conChunkSize = 32768 
     
     Dim lngOffset As Long 
     Dim lngTotalSize As Long 
     Dim strChunk As String 
     
     ' Copy the photo from one Recordset to the other in 32K 
     ' chunks until the entire field is copied. 
     lngTotalSize = fldSource.FieldSize 
     Do While lngOffset < lngTotalSize 
     strChunk = fldSource.GetChunk(lngOffset, conChunkSize) 
     fldDestination.AppendChunk strChunk 
     lngOffset = lngOffset + conChunkSize 
     Loop 
     
    End Function
