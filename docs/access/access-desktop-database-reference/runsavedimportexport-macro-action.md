# RunSavedImportExport Macro Action


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

You can use the **RunSavedImportExport** action to run a saved import or export specification that you created by using the Import Wizard or the Export Wizard.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>This action will not be allowed if the database is not trusted. For more information about enabling macros, see the links in the See Also section of this article.</P>



## Setting

The **RunSavedImportExport** action has the following argument.

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><p>Action argument</p></th>
<th><p>Description</p></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>Saved Import Export Name</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Select the name of a saved import or export specification from the drop-down list.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


## Remarks

  - This macro action has the same effect as performing the following procedure in Access:
    
    1.  On the **External Data** tab, click either **Saved Imports** or **Saved Exports**.
    
    2.  In the **Manage Data Tasks** dialog box, on the **Saved Imports** or **Saved Exports** tab (depending on your choice in the preceding step), click the specification that you want to run.
    
    3.  Click **Run**.

  - Before running the **RunSavedImportExport** action, make sure that the source and destination files exist, the source data is ready for importing, and that the operation will not accidentally overwrite any data in your destination file.

  - Find links to more information about saving and running import and export specifications in the **See Also** section.

  - If the saved import or export specification you choose for the **Saved Import Export Name** argument is deleted after the macro is created, Access displays the following error message when the macro is run: **The specification with the specified index does not exist. Specify a different index. '*****specification name*****'.**
