# Open Method (ADO Stream)


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

**In this article**  
Syntax  
Parameters  
Remarks  

Opens a [Stream](stream-object-ado.md) object to manipulate streams of binary or text data.

## Syntax

*Stream*. Open *Source*, *Mode*, *OpenOptions*, *UserName*, *Password*

## Parameters

  - *Source*

  - Optional. A **Variant** value that specifies the source of data for the **Stream**. *Source* may contain an absolute URL string that points to an existing node in a well-known tree structure, like an e-mail or file system. A URL should be specified using the URL keyword ("URL=*scheme*://*server*/*folder*"). Alternately, *Source* may contain a reference to an already open [Record](record-object-ado.md) object, which opens the default stream associated with the **Record**. If *Source* is not specified, a **Stream** is instantiated and opened, associated with no underlying source by default. For more information about URL schemes and their associated providers, see [Absolute and Relative URLs](absolute-and-relative-urls.md).

  - *Mode*

  - Optional. A [ConnectModeEnum](connectmodeenum.md) value that specifies the access mode for the resultant **Stream** (for example, read/write or read-only). Default value is **adModeUnknown**. See the [Mode](mode-property-ado.md) property for more information about access modes. If *Mode* is not specified, it is inherited by the source object. For example, if the source **Record** is opened in read-only mode, the **Stream** will also be opened in read-only mode by default.

  - *OpenOptions*

  - Optional. A [StreamOpenOptionsEnum](streamopenoptionsenum.md) value. Default value is **adOpenStreamUnspecified**.

  - *UserName*

  - Optional. A **String** value that contains the user identification that, if needed, accesses the **Stream** object.

  - *Password*

  - Optional. A **String** value that contains the password that, if needed, accesses the **Stream** object.

## Remarks

When a **Record** object is passed in as the source parameter, the *UserID* and *Password* parameters are not used because access to the **Record** object is already available. Similarly, the [Mode](mode-property-ado.md) of the **Record** object is transferred to the **Stream** object.When *Source* is not specified, the **Stream** opened contains no data and has a [Size](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/jj250128\(v=office.15\)) of zero (0). To avoid losing any data that is written to this **Stream** when the **Stream** is closed, save the **Stream** with the [CopyTo](copyto-method-ado.md) or [SaveToFile](savetofile-method-ado.md) methods, or save it to another memory location.

An *OpenOptions* value of **adOpenStreamFromRecord** identifies the contents of the *Source* parameter to be an already open **Record** object. The default behavior is to treat *Source* as a URL that points directly to a node in a tree structure, such as a file. The default stream associated with that node is opened.

While the **Stream** is not open, it is possible to read all the read-only properties of the **Stream**. If a **Stream** is opened asynchronously, all subsequent operations (other than checking the [State](state-property-ado.md) and other read-only properties) are blocked until the **Open** operation is completed.

In addition to the options discussed above, by not specifying *Source*, you can simply instantiate a **Stream** object in memory without associating it with an underlying source. You can dynamically add data to the stream simply by writing binary or text data to the **Stream** with [Write](write-method-ado.md) or [WriteText](writetext-method-ado.md), or by loading data from a file with [LoadFromFile](loadfromfile-method-ado.md).
