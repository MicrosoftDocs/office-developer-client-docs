# Connection.StillExecuting Property (DAO)


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

**In this article**  
Syntax  
Remarks  
Example  

## Syntax

*expression* .StillExecuting

*expression* A variable that represents a **Connection** object.

## Remarks

Use the **StillExecuting** property to determine if the most recently called asynchronous **Execute** or **OpenConnection** method (that is, a method executed with the **dbRunAsync** option) is complete. While the **StillExecuting** property is **True**, any returned object cannot be accessed.

Once the **StillExecuting** property returns **False**, following the **OpenConnection** call that returns the associated **Connection** object, the object can be referenced. So long as **StillExecuting** remains **True**, the object may not be referenced, other than to read the **StillExecuting** property.

Use the **[Cancel](connection-cancel-method-dao.md)** method to terminate execution of a task in progress.

## Example

This example uses the **StillExecuting** property and the **Cancel** method to asynchronously open a **Connection** object.

    Sub CancelConnectionX() 
     
     Dim wrkMain As Workspace 
     Dim conMain As Connection 
     Dim sngTime As Single 
     
     Set wrkMain = CreateWorkspace("ODBCWorkspace", _ 
     "admin", "", dbUseODBC) 
     ' Open the connection asynchronously. 
     
     ' Note: The DSN referenced below must be configured to 
     ' use Microsoft Windows NT Authentication Mode to 
     ' authorize user access to the Microsoft SQL Server. 
     Set conMain = wrkMain.OpenConnection("Publishers", _ 
     dbDriverNoPrompt + dbRunAsync, False, _ 
     "ODBC;DATABASE=pubs;DSN=Publishers") 
     
     sngTime = Timer 
     
     ' Wait five seconds. 
     Do While Timer - sngTime < 5 
     Loop 
     
     ' If the connection has not been made, ask the user 
     ' if she wants to keep waiting. If she does not, cancel 
     ' the connection and exit the procedure. 
     Do While conMain.StillExecuting 
     
     If MsgBox("No connection yet--keep waiting?", _ 
     vbYesNo) = vbNo Then 
     conMain.Cancel 
     MsgBox "Connection cancelled!" 
     wrkMain.Close 
     Exit Sub 
     End If 
     
     Loop 
     
     With conMain 
     ' Use the Connection object conMain. 
     .Close 
     End With 
     
     wrkMain.Close 
     
    End Sub
