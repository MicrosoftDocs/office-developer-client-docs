# Chapter 1: ADO Fundamentals


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

This chapter is an introduction to the ADO library. It discusses what you can do with ADO, reviews the objects in the ADO hierarchy, and presents a simple ADO application that uses many of the ADO objects to retrieve, edit, and update data from a data source. Finally, this chapter covers two issues that are important to understand for writing ADO applications: OLE DB providers and errors.
