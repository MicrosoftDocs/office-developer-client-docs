About the Contributors  

You can use the **SetFilter** action to apply a filter to the records in the active datasheet, form, report, or table.

## Setting

The **SetFilter** action has the following arguments.

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><p>Action argument</p></th>
<th><p>Description</p></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Filter Name</p></td>
<td><p>If provided, the name of a query or of a filter saved as a query. This argument or the WhereCondition argument is required in a client database. In a Web database, this argument is not available.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Where Condition</p></td>
<td><p>If provided, a SQL WHERE clause that restricts the records in the datasheet, form, report, or table. In a Web database, this argument is required.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Control Name</p></td>
<td><p>If provided, the name of the control that corresponds to the subform or subreport to be filtered. If empty, the current object is filtered.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


## Remarks

In a web database, the Where Condition argument cannot begin with an equal sign (=).

When you run this action, the filter is applied to the table, form, report or datasheet (for example, query result) that is active and has the focus.

The **Filter** property of the active object is used to save the WhereCondition argument and apply it at a later time. Filters are saved with the objects in which they are created. They are automatically loaded when the object is opened, but they are not automatically applied.

In a client database, to automatically apply a filter when the object is opened, set the **FilterOnLoad** property to True.

In a web database, to automatically apply a filter when the object is opened, add the **SetFilter** action to a macro, and add the macro to the object's **OnLoad** event.

## Example

The following example shows how to use the SetFilter action to filter the form in which the macro is defined.
