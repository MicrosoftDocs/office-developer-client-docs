# Connect Property (RDS)


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

Indicates the database name from which the query and update operations are run.

You can set the **Connect** property at design time in the [RDS.DataControl](datacontrol-object-rds.md) object's OBJECT tags, or at run time in scripting code (for instance, VBScript).

## Syntax

Design time: \<PARAM NAME="Connect" VALUE="ConnectionString"\>

Run time: DataControl.Connect = "ConnectionString"

## Parameters

  - *ConnectionString*

  - A valid connection string. For more general information about connection strings, see the [ConnectionString](connectionstring-property-ado.md) property or your provider documentation.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>Specifying MS Remote as the provider for the <STRONG>RDS.DataControl</STRONG> would create a four-tier scenario. Scenarios greater than three tiers have not been tested and should not be needed.</P>



  - *DataControl*

  - An object variable that represents an **RDS.DataControl** object.
