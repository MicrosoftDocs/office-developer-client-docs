About the Contributors  

Locates the record in an indexed table-type **Recordset** object that satisfies the specified criteria for the current index and makes that record the current record (Microsoft Access workspaces only).

## Syntax

*expression* .Seek(***Comparison***, ***Key1***, ***Key2***, ***Key3***, ***Key4***, ***Key5***, ***Key6***, ***Key7***, ***Key8***, ***Key9***, ***Key10***, ***Key11***, ***Key12***, ***Key13***)

*expression* A variable that represents a **Recordset** object.

### Parameters

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 25%" />
<col style="width: 25%" />
<col style="width: 25%" />
<col style="width: 25%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><p>Name</p></th>
<th><p>Required/Optional</p></th>
<th><p>Data Type</p></th>
<th><p>Description</p></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Comparison</p></td>
<td><p>Required</p></td>
<td><p><strong>String</strong></p></td>
<td><p>One of the following string expressions: &lt;, &lt;=, =, &gt;=, or &gt;.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Key1, Key2...Key13</p></td>
<td><p>Required</p></td>
<td><p><strong>Variant</strong></p></td>
<td><p>One or more values corresponding to fields in the <strong>Recordset</strong> object's current index, as specified by its <strong>Index</strong> property setting. You can use up to 13 key arguments.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


## Remarks

You must set the current index with the **Index** property before you use **Seek**. If the index identifies a nonunique key field, **Seek** locates the first record that satisfies the criteria.

The **Seek** method searches through the specified key fields and locates the first record that satisfies the criteria specified by comparison and key1. Once found, it makes that record current and sets the **NoMatch** property to **False**. If the **Seek** method fails to locate a match, the **NoMatch** property is set to **True**, and the current record is undefined.

If comparison is equal (=), greater than or equal (\>=), or greater than (\>), **Seek** starts at the beginning of the index and searches forward.

If comparison is less than (\<) or less than or equal (\<=), **Seek** starts at the end of the index and searches backward. However, if there are duplicate index entries at the end of the index, **Seek** starts at an arbitrary entry among the duplicates and then searches backward.

You must specify values for all fields defined in the index. If you use **Seek** with a multiple-column index, and you don't specify a comparison value for every field in the index, then you cannot use the equal (=) operator in the comparison. That's because some of the criteria fields (key2, key3, and so on) will default to Null, which will probably not match. Therefore, the equal operator will work correctly only if you have a record which is all **null** except the key you're looking for. It's recommended that you use the greater than or equal (\>=) operator instead.

The key1 argument must be of the same field data type as the corresponding field in the current index. For example, if the current index refers to a number field (such as Employee ID), key1 must be numeric. Similarly, if the current index refers to a Text field (such as Last Name), key1 must be a string.

There doesn't have to be a current record when you use **Seek**.

You can use the **[Indexes](indexes-collection-dao.md)** collection to enumerate the existing indexes.

To locate a record in a dynaset- or snapshot-type **Recordset** that satisfies a specific condition that is not covered by existing indexes, use the **[Find](recordset-findfirst-method-dao.md)** methods. To include all records, not just those that satisfy a specific condition, use the **[Move](recordset-movefirst-method-dao.md)** methods to move from record to record.

You can't use the **Seek** method on a linked table because you can't open linked tables as table-type **Recordset** objects. However, if you use the **[OpenDatabase](dbengine-opendatabase-method-dao.md)** method to directly open an installable ISAM (non-ODBC) database, you can use **Seek** on tables in that database.

## Example

This example demonstrates the **Seek** method by allowing the user to search for a product based on an ID number.

    Sub SeekX() 
     
       Dim dbsNorthwind As Database 
       Dim rstProducts As Recordset 
       Dim intFirst As Integer 
       Dim intLast As Integer 
       Dim strMessage As String 
       Dim strSeek As String 
       Dim varBookmark As Variant 
     
       Set dbsNorthwind = OpenDatabase("Northwind.mdb") 
       ' You must open a table-type Recordset to use an index,  
       ' and hence the Seek method. 
       Set rstProducts = _ 
          dbsNorthwind.OpenRecordset("Products", dbOpenTable) 
     
       With rstProducts 
          ' Set the index. 
          .Index = "PrimaryKey" 
     
          ' Get the lowest and highest product IDs. 
          .MoveLast 
          intLast = !ProductID 
          .MoveFirst 
          intFirst = !ProductID 
     
          Do While True 
             ' Display current record information and ask user  
             ' for ID number. 
             strMessage = "Product ID: " & !ProductID & vbCr & _ 
                "Name: " & !ProductName & vbCr & vbCr & _ 
                "Enter a product ID between " & intFirst & _ 
                " and " & intLast & "." 
             strSeek = InputBox(strMessage) 
     
             If strSeek = "" Then Exit Do 
     
             ' Store current bookmark in case the Seek fails. 
             varBookmark = .Bookmark 
     
             .Seek "=", Val(strSeek) 
     
             ' Return to the current record if the Seek fails. 
             If .NoMatch Then 
                MsgBox "ID not found!" 
                .Bookmark = varBookmark 
             End If 
          Loop 
     
          .Close 
       End With 
     
       dbsNorthwind.Close 
     
    End Sub 

This example uses the **NoMatch** property to determine whether a **Seek** and a **FindFirst** were successful, and if not, to give appropriate feedback. The SeekMatch and FindMatch procedures are required for this procedure to run.

    Sub NoMatchX() 
     
       Dim dbsNorthwind As Database 
       Dim rstProducts As Recordset 
       Dim rstCustomers As Recordset 
       Dim strMessage As String 
       Dim strSeek As String 
       Dim strCountry As String 
       Dim varBookmark As Variant 
     
       Set dbsNorthwind = OpenDatabase("Northwind.mdb") 
       ' Default is dbOpenTable; required if Index property will  
       ' be used. 
       Set rstProducts = dbsNorthwind.OpenRecordset("Products") 
     
       With rstProducts 
          .Index = "PrimaryKey" 
     
          Do While True 
             ' Show current record information; ask user for  
             ' input. 
             strMessage = "NoMatch with Seek method" & vbCr & _ 
                "Product ID: " & !ProductID & vbCr & _ 
                "Product Name: " & !ProductName & vbCr & _ 
                "NoMatch = " & .NoMatch & vbCr & vbCr & _ 
                "Enter a product ID." 
             strSeek = InputBox(strMessage) 
             If strSeek = "" Then Exit Do 
     
             ' Call procedure that seeks for a record based on  
             ' the ID number supplied by the user. 
             SeekMatch rstProducts, Val(strSeek) 
          Loop 
     
          .Close 
       End With 
     
       Set rstCustomers = dbsNorthwind.OpenRecordset( _ 
          "SELECT CompanyName, Country FROM Customers " & _ 
          "ORDER BY CompanyName", dbOpenSnapshot) 
     
       With rstCustomers 
     
          Do While True 
             ' Show current record information; ask user for  
             ' input. 
             strMessage = "NoMatch with FindFirst method" & _ 
                vbCr & "Customer Name: " & !CompanyName & _ 
                vbCr & "Country: " & !Country & vbCr & _ 
                "NoMatch = " & .NoMatch & vbCr & vbCr & _ 
                "Enter country on which to search." 
             strCountry = Trim(InputBox(strMessage)) 
             If strCountry = "" Then Exit Do 
     
             ' Call procedure that finds a record based on  
             ' the country name supplied by the user. 
             FindMatch rstCustomers, _ 
                "Country = '" & strCountry & "'" 
          Loop 
     
          .Close 
       End With 
     
       dbsNorthwind.Close 
     
    End Sub 
     
    Sub SeekMatch(rstTemp As Recordset, _ 
       intSeek As Integer) 
     
       Dim varBookmark As Variant 
       Dim strMessage As String 
     
       With rstTemp 
          ' Store current record location. 
          varBookmark = .Bookmark 
          .Seek "=", intSeek 
     
          ' If Seek method fails, notify user and return to the  
          ' last current record. 
          If .NoMatch Then 
             strMessage = _ 
                "Not found! Returning to current record." & _ 
                vbCr & vbCr & "NoMatch = " & .NoMatch 
             MsgBox strMessage 
             .Bookmark = varBookmark 
          End If 
     
       End With 
     
    End Sub 
     
    Sub FindMatch(rstTemp As Recordset, _ 
       strFind As String) 
     
       Dim varBookmark As Variant 
       Dim strMessage As String

          ' Store current record location. 
          varBookmark = .Bookmark 
          .FindFirst strFind 
     
          ' If Find method fails, notify user and return to the  
          ' last current record.
