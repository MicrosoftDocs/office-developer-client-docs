# DataMember Property (ADO)


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

Indicates the name of the data member that will be retrieved from the object referenced by the [DataSource](datasource-property-ado.md) property.

## Settings and Return Values

Sets or returns a **String** value. The name is not case sensitive.

## Remarks

This property is used to create data-bound controls with the Data Environment. The Data Environment maintains collections of data (data sources) containing named objects (*data members*) that will be represented as a [Recordset](recordset-object-ado.md) object*.*

The **DataMember** and **DataSource** properties must be used in conjunction.

The **DataMember** property determines which object specified by the **DataSource** property will be represented as a **Recordset** object. The **Recordset** object must be closed before this property is set. An error is generated if the **DataMember** property isn't set before the **DataSource** property, or if the **DataMember** name isn't recognized by the object specified in the **DataSource** property.

**Usage**

    Dim rs as New ADODB.Recordset
    rs.DataMember = "Command"     'Name of the rowset to bind to
    Set rs.DataSource = myDE      'Name of the object containing an IRowset
