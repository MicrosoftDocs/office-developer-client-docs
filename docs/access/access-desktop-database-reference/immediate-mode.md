# Immediate Mode


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

Immediate mode is in effect when the **LockType** property is set to **adLockOptimistic** or **adLockPessimistic**. In immediate mode, changes to a record are propagated to the data source as soon as you declare the work on a row complete by calling the **Update** method.

## Calling Update

If you move from the record you are adding or editing before calling the **Update** method, ADO will automatically call **Update** to save the changes. You must call the **CancelUpdate** method before navigation if you want to cancel any changes made to the current record or discard a newly added record.

The current record remains current after you call the **Update** method.

## CancelUpdate

Use the **CancelUpdate** method to cancel any changes made to the current row or to discard a newly added row. You cannot cancel changes to the current row or a new row after you call the **Update** method, unless the changes are either part of a transaction that you can roll back with the **RollbackTrans** method or part of a batch update. In the case of a batch update, you can cancel the **Update** with the **CancelUpdate** or **CancelBatch** method.

If you are adding a new row when you call the **CancelUpdate** method, the current row becomes the row that was current before the **AddNew** call.

If you have not changed the current row or added a new row, calling the **CancelUpdate** method generates an error.
