# StopAllMacros Macro Action


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

You can use the **StopAllMacros** action to stop all macros that are currently running.

## Setting

The **StopAllMacros** action doesn't have any arguments.

## Remarks

You typically use this action when an error condition makes it necessary to stop all macros. You can use a conditional expression in the macro's action row that contains this action. When the expression evaluates to **True** (–1), Microsoft Access stops all macros.

For example, you might have a macro that displays a message box as one of a number of complex actions, including running other macros. If the user clicks **Cancel** in this message box, the **StopAllMacros** action can stop all the macros that are running.

If a macro has used the **Echo** or **SetWarnings** actions to turn echo or the display of system messages off, the **StopAllMacros** action automatically turns them back on.

This action isn't available in a Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) module.
