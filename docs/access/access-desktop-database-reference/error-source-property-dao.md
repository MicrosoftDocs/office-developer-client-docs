# Error.Source Property (DAO)


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

**In this article**  
Syntax  
Remarks  
Example  

Returns the name of the object or application that originally generated the error.

## Syntax

*expression* .Source

*expression* A variable that represents an **Error** object.

## Remarks

The **Source** property value is usually the object's class name or programmatic ID. Use the **Source** property to provide your users with information when your code is unable to handle an error generated in an object in another application.

For example, if you access Microsoft Excel and it generates a "Division by zero" error, Microsoft Excel sets **Error.Number** to the Microsoft Excel code for that error and sets the **Source** property to Excel.Application. Note that if the error is generated in another object called by Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Excel intercepts the error and still sets **Error.Number** to the Microsoft Excel code. However, the other **Error** object properties (including **Source**) will retain the values as set by the object that generated the error. The **Source** property always contains the name of the object that originally generated the error.

Based on all of the error documentation, you can write code that will handle the error appropriately. If your error handler fails, you can use the **[Error](error-object-dao.md)** object information to describe the error to your user, using the **Source** property and the other **Error** properties to give the user information about which object originally caused the error, the description of the error, and so forth.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>The <STRONG>On Error Resume Next</STRONG> construct may be preferable to <STRONG>On Error GoTo</STRONG> when dealing with errors generated during access to other objects. Checking the <STRONG>Error</STRONG> object property after each interaction with an object removes ambiguity about which object your code was accessing when the error occurred. Thus, you can be sure which object placed the error code in <STRONG>Error.Number</STRONG>, as well as which object originally generated the error (<STRONG>Error.Source</STRONG>).</P>



## Example

This example forces an error, traps it, and displays the **Description**, **Number**, **Source**, **HelpContext**, and **HelpFile** properties of the resulting **Error** object.

    Sub DescriptionX() 
     
     Dim dbsTest As Database 
     
     On Error GoTo ErrorHandler 
     
     ' Intentionally trigger an error. 
     Set dbsTest = OpenDatabase("NoDatabase") 
     
     Exit Sub 
     
    ErrorHandler: 
     Dim strError As String 
     Dim errLoop As Error 
     
     ' Enumerate Errors collection and display properties of 
     ' each Error object. 
     For Each errLoop In Errors 
     With errLoop 
     strError = _ 
     "Error #" & .Number & vbCr 
     strError = strError & _ 
     " " & .Description & vbCr 
     strError = strError & _ 
     " (Source: " & .Source & ")" & vbCr 
     strError = strError & _ 
     "Press F1 to see topic " & .HelpContext & vbCr 
     strError = strError & _ 
     " in the file " & .HelpFile & "." 
     End With 
     MsgBox strError 
     Next 
     
     Resume Next 
     
    End Sub
