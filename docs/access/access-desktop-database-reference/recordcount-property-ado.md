# RecordCount Property (ADO)


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

Indicates the number of records in a [Recordset](recordset-object-ado.md) object.

## Return Value

Returns a **Long** value that indicates the number of records in the **Recordset**.

## Remarks

Use the **RecordCount** property to find out how many records are in a **Recordset** object. The property returns -1 when ADO cannot determine the number of records or if the provider or cursor type does not support **RecordCount**. Reading the **RecordCount** property on a closed **Recordset** causes an error.

If the **Recordset** object supports approximate positioning or bookmarks — that is, **Supports (adApproxPosition)** or **Supports (adBookmark)**, respectively, return **True** — this value will be the exact number of records in the **Recordset**, regardless of whether it has been fully populated. If the **Recordset** object does not support approximate positioning, this property may be a significant drain on resources because all records will have to be retrieved and counted to return an accurate **RecordCount** value.

The cursor type of the **Recordset** object affects whether the number of records can be determined. The **RecordCount** property will return -1 for a forward-only cursor; the actual count for a static or keyset cursor; and either -1 or the actual count for a dynamic cursor, depending on the data source.
