# Workspace.IsolateODBCTrans Property (DAO)


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

Sets or returns a value that indicates whether multiple transactiond that involve the same Microsoft Access database engine-connected ODBC data source are isolated (Microsoft Access workspaces only).

## Syntax

*expression* .IsolateODBCTrans

*expression* A variable that represents a **Workspace** object.

## Remarks

In some situations, you need to have multiple simultaneous transactions pending on the same ODBC connection. To do this, you need to open a separate **Workspace** for each transaction. Although each **Workspace** can have its own ODBC connection to the database, this slows system performance. Because transaction isolation isn't usually required, ODBC connections from multiple **Workspace** objects opened by the same user are shared by default.

Some ODBC servers, such as Microsoft SQL Server, don't allow simultaneous transactions on a single connection. If you need to have more than one transaction at a time pending against such a database, set the **IsolateODBCTrans** property to **True** on each **Workspace** as soon as you open it. This forces a separate ODBC connection for each **Workspace**.
