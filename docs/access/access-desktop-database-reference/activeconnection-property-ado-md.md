# ActiveConnection Property (ADO MD)


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

Indicates to which ADO [Connection](connection-object-ado.md) object the current cellset or catalog currently belongs.

## Settings and Return Values

Sets or returns a **Variant** that contains a string defining a connection or **Connection** object. The default is empty.

## Remarks

You can set this property to a valid ADO **Connection** object or to a valid connection string. When this property is set to a connection string, the provider creates a new **Connection** object using this definition and opens the connection.

If you use the **ActiveConnection** argument of the [Open](open-method-ado-md.md) method to open a [Cellset](cellset-object-ado-md.md) object, the **ActiveConnection** property will inherit the value of the argument.

Setting the **ActiveConnection** property of a [Catalog](catalog-object-ado-md.md) object to **Nothing** releases the associated data, including data in the [CubeDefs](cubedefs-collection-ado-md.md) collection and any related [Dimension](dimension-object-ado-md.md), [Hierarchy](hierarchy-object-ado-md.md), [Level](level-object-ado-md.md), and [Member](member-object-ado-md.md) objects. Closing a **Connection** object that was used to open a **Catalog** has the same effect as setting the **ActiveConnection** property to **Nothing**.

Changing the default database of the connection referenced by the **ActiveConnection** property of a **Catalog** object invalidates the contents of the **Catalog**.

An error will occur if you attempt to change the **ActiveConnection** property for an open **Cellset** object.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>In Visual Basic, remember to use the <STRONG>Set</STRONG> keyword when setting the <STRONG>ActiveConnection</STRONG> property to a <STRONG>Connection</STRONG> object. If you omit the <STRONG>Set</STRONG> keyword, you will actually be setting the <STRONG>ActiveConnection</STRONG> property equal to the <STRONG>Connection</STRONG> object's default property, <STRONG>ConnectionString</STRONG>. The code will work; however, you will create an additional connection to the data source, which may have negative performance implications.</P>



When using the MSOLAP data provider, set the data source in a connection string to a server name and set the initial catalog to the name of a catalog from the data source. To connect to a cube file that is disconnected from a server, set the location to the full path to the .CUB file. In either case, set the provider to the provider name. For example, the following string connects to a catalog named Bobs Video Store on a server named Servername with the MSOLAP Provider:

    "Data Source=Servername;Initial Catalog=Bobs Video Store;Provider=msolap"

The following string connects to a local cube file at the location C:\\MSDASDK\\samples\\oledb\\olap\\data\\bobsvid.cub:

    "Location=C:\MSDASDK\samples\oledb\olap\data\bobsvid.cub;Provider=msolap"
