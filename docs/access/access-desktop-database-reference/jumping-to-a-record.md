# Jumping to a Record


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

The [Move](move-method-ado.md) method allows you to move forward or backward in the **Recordset** a specified number of records by using the following syntax:

``` 
 
oRs.Move NumRecords, Start
```

The **Move** method is supported on all **Recordset** objects.

If the *NumRecords* argument is greater than zero, the current record position moves forward (toward the end of the **Recordset**). If *NumRecords* is less than zero, the current record position moves backward (toward the beginning of the **Recordset**).

If the **Move** call would move the current record position to a point before the first record, ADO sets the current record to the position before the first record in the **Recordset** (**BOF** is **True**). An attempt to move backward when the **BOF** property is already **True** generates an error.

If the **Move** call would move the current record position to a point after the last record, ADO sets the current record to the position after the last record in the **Recordset** (**EOF** is **True**). An attempt to move forward when the **EOF** property is already **True** generates an error.

Calling the **Move** method from an empty **Recordset** object generates an error.

If you pass a bookmark in the *Start* argument, the move is relative to the record with this bookmark, assuming the **Recordset** object supports bookmarks. A bookmark is obtained by using the [Bookmark](bookmark-property-ado.md) property. If not specified, the move is relative to the current record.

If you are using the **CacheSize** property to locally cache records from the provider, passing a *NumRecords* argument that moves the current record position outside the current group of cached records forces ADO to retrieve a new group of records, starting from the destination record. The **CacheSize** property determines the size of the newly retrieved group, and the destination record is the first record retrieved.
