# Requery Method (ADO)


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

**In this article**  
Syntax  
Parameter  
Remarks  

Updates the data in a [Recordset](recordset-object-ado.md) object by re-executing the query on which the object is based.

## Syntax

*recordset*.Requery *Options*

## Parameter

  - *Options*

  - Optional. A bitmask that contains [ExecuteOptionEnum](executeoptionenum.md) and [CommandTypeEnum](commandtypeenum.md) values affecting this operation.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>If <EM>Options</EM> is set to <STRONG>adAsyncExecute</STRONG>, this operation will execute asynchronously and a <A href="willchangerecordset-and-recordsetchangecomplete-events-ado.md">RecordsetChangeComplete</A> event will be issued when it concludes.</P>



The **ExecuteOpenEnum** values of **adExecuteNoRecords** or **adExecuteStream** should not be used with **Requery**.

## Remarks

Use the **Requery** method to refresh the entire contents of a **Recordset** object from the data source by reissuing the original command and retrieving the data a second time. Calling this method is equivalent to calling the [Close](close-method-ado.md) and [Open](open-method-ado-recordset.md) methods in succession. If you are editing the current record or adding a new record, an error occurs.

While the **Recordset** object is open, the properties that define the nature of the cursor ([CursorType](cursortype-property-ado.md), [LockType](locktype-property-ado.md), [MaxRecords](maxrecords-property-ado.md), and so forth) are read-only. Thus, the **Requery** method can only refresh the current cursor. To change any of the cursor properties and view the results, you must use the [Close](close-method-ado.md) method so that the properties become read/write again. You can then change the property settings and call the [Open](open-method-ado-recordset.md) method to reopen the cursor.
