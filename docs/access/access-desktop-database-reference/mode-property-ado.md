# Mode Property (ADO)


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

Indicates the available permissions for modifying data in a [Connection](connection-object-ado.md), [Record](record-object-ado.md), or [Stream](stream-object-ado.md) object.

## Settings and Return Values

Sets or returns a [ConnectModeEnum](connectmodeenum.md) value. The default value for a **Connection** is **adModeUnknown**. The default value for a **Record** object is **adModeRead**. The default value for a **Stream** associated with an underlying source (opened with a URL as the source, or as the default **Stream** of a **Record**) is **adModeRead**. The default value for a **Stream** not associated with an underlying source (instantiated in memory) is **adModeUnknown**.

## Remarks

Use the **Mode** property to set or return the access permissions in use by the provider on the current connection. You can set the **Mode** property only when the **Connection** object is closed.

For a **Stream** object, if the access mode is not specified, it is inherited from the source used to open the **Stream** object. For example, if a **Stream** is opened from a **Record** object, by default it is opened in the same mode as the **Record**.

This property is read/write while the object is closed and read-only while the object is open.

**Remote Data Service Usage**When used on a client-side Connection object, the **Mode** property can only be set to **adModeUnknown**.
