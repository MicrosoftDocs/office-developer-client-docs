# Reshaping


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

A **Recordset** created by a clause of a shape command may be assigned an *alias* name (typically with the AS keyword). The alias of a shaped **Recordset** can be referenced in an entirely different command. That is, you may reuse, or *reshape*, a previously shaped **Recordset** in a new shape command. To support this feature, ADO provides a property, [Reshape Name](reshape-name-property-dynamic-ado.md).

Reshaping has two main functions. The first is to associate an existing **Recordset** with a new parent **Recordset**.

## Example

``` 
 
. . . 
rs1.Open "SHAPE {select * from Customers} " & _ 
 "APPEND ({select * from Orders} AS chapOrders " & _ 
 "RELATE CustomerID to CustomerID)", cn 
 
rs2.Open "SHAPE {select * from Employees} " & _ 
 "APPEND (chapOrders RELATE EmployeeID to EmployeeID)", cn 
. . . 
```

The second function is to enable non-chaptered access to existing child **Recordset** objects, using the syntax "SHAPE \<recordset reshape name\>".


> [!NOTE]
> <P>You cannot append columns to an existing <STRONG>Recordset</STRONG>, reshape a parameterized <STRONG>Recordset</STRONG> or the <STRONG>Recordset</STRONG> objects in any intervening COMPUTE clause, or perform aggregate operations on any <STRONG>Recordset</STRONG> descendant from the <STRONG>Recordset</STRONG> being reshaped. The <STRONG>Recordset</STRONG> being reshaped and the new shape command must both use the same <A href="connection-object-ado.md">Connection</A>.</P>
