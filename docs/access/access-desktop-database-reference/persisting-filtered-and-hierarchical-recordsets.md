# Persisting Filtered and Hierarchical Recordsets


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

If the [Filter](filter-property-ado.md) property is in effect for the **Recordset**, only the rows accessible under the filter are saved. If the **Recordset** is hierarchical, the current child **Recordset** and its children are saved, including the parent **Recordset**. If the **Save** method of a child **Recordset** is called, the child and all its children are saved, but the parent is not. For more information about hierarchical **Recordsets**, see [Chapter 9: Data Shaping](chapter-9-data-shaping.md).

> <P>Some limitations apply when saving hierarchical <STRONG>Recordsets</STRONG> (data shapes) in XML format. For more information, see <A href="hierarchical-recordsets-in-xml.md">Hierarchical Recordsets in XML</A>.</P>
