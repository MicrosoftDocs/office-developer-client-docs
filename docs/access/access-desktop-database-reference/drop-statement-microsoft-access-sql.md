# DROP Statement (Microsoft Access SQL)


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

**In this article**  
Syntax  
Remarks  
Example  

Deletes an existing table, procedure, or view from a database, or deletes an existing index from a table.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>The Microsoft Access database engine does not support the use of DROP, or any of the DDL statements, with non-Microsoft Access database engine databases. Use the DAO <STRONG>Delete</STRONG> method instead.</P>



## Syntax

DROP {TABLE *table* | INDEX *index* ON *table* | PROCEDURE *procedure* | VIEW *view*}

The DROP statement has these parts:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><p>Part</p></th>
<th><p>Description</p></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><em>table</em></p></td>
<td><p>The name of the table to be deleted or the table from which an index is to be deleted.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p><em>procedure</em></p></td>
<td><p>The name of the procedure to be deleted.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><em>view</em></p></td>
<td><p>The name of the view to be deleted.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p><em>index</em></p></td>
<td><p>The name of the index to be deleted from <em>table.</em></p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


## Remarks

You must close the table before you can delete it or remove an index from it.

You can also use [ALTER TABLE](alter-table-statement-microsoft-access-sql.md) to delete an index from a table.

You can use [CREATE TABLE](create-table-statement-microsoft-access-sql.md) to create a table and [CREATE INDEX](create-index-statement-microsoft-access-sql.md) or ALTER TABLE to create an index. To modify a table, use ALTER TABLE.

## Example

The following example assumes the existence of a hypothetical NewIndex index on the Employees table in the Northwind database.

This example deletes the index MyIndex from the Employees table.

    Sub DropX1() 
     
        Dim dbs As Database 
     
        ' Modify this line to include the path to Northwind 
        ' on your computer. 
        Set dbs = OpenDatabase("Northwind.mdb") 
     
        ' Delete NewIndex from the Employees table. 
        dbs.Execute "DROP INDEX NewIndex ON Employees;" 
     
        dbs.Close 
     
    End Sub

This example deletes the Employees table from the database.

    Sub DropX2() 
     
        Dim dbs As Database 
     
        ' Modify this line to include the path to Northwind 
        ' on your computer. 
        Set dbs = OpenDatabase("Northwind.mdb") 
     
        ' Delete the Employees table. 
        dbs.Execute "DROP TABLE Employees;" 
     
        dbs.Close 
     
    End Sub
