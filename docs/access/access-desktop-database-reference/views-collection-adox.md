# Views Collection (ADOX)


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

Contains all [View](view-object-adox.md) objects of a catalog.

  - Access a view in the collection with the [Item](item-property-ado.md) property.

  - Return the number of views contained in the collection with the [Count](count-property-ado.md) property.

  - Remove a view from the collection with the [Delete](delete-method-adox-collections.md) method.
