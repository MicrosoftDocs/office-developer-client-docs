# OpenView Macro Action


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

In an Access project, you can use the **OpenView** action to open a view in Datasheet view, Design view, or Print Preview. This action runs the named view when opened in Datasheet view. You can select data entry for the view and restrict the records that the view displays.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>This action will not be allowed if the database is not trusted. For more information about enabling macros, see the links in the See Also section of this article.</P>



## Setting

The **OpenView** action has the following arguments.

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><p>Action argument</p></th>
<th><p>Description</p></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>View Name</strong></p></td>
<td><p>The name of the view to open. The <strong>View Name</strong> box in the <strong>Action Arguments</strong> section of the Macro Builder pane shows all views in the current database. This is a required argument. If you run a macro containing the <strong>OpenView</strong> action in a library database, Microsoft Access first looks for the view with this name in the library database, and then in the current database.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p><strong>View</strong></p></td>
<td><p>The view in which the view will open. Click <strong>Datasheet</strong>, <strong>Design</strong>, <strong>Print Preview</strong>, <strong>PivotTable</strong>, or <strong>PivotChart</strong> in the <strong>View</strong> box. The default is <strong>Datasheet</strong>.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>Data Mode</strong></p></td>
<td><p>The data entry mode for the view. This applies only to views opened in Datasheet view. Click <strong>Add</strong> (the user can add new records but can't view or edit existing records), <strong>Edit</strong> (the user can view or edit existing records and add new records), or <strong>Read Only</strong> (the user can only view records). The default is <strong>Edit</strong>.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


## Remarks

This action is similar to double-clicking a view in the Navigation Pane, or right-clicking the view in the Navigation Pane and then clicking the command you want.

**Tips**

  - You can drag a view from the Navigation Pane to a macro action row. This automatically creates an **OpenView** action that opens the view in Datasheet view.

  - If you don't want to display the system messages that normally appear when a view is run (indicating it is a view and showing how many records will be affected), you can use the **SetWarning** action to suppress the display of these messages.

To run the **OpenView** action in a Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) module, use the **OpenView** method of the **DoCmd** object.
