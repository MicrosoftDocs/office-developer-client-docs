# EndOfRecordset Event (ADO)


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

**In this article**  
Syntax  
Parameters  
Remarks  

The **EndOfRecordset** event is called when there is an attempt to move to a row past the end of the [Recordset](recordset-object-ado.md).

## Syntax

EndOfRecordset*fMoreData*, *adStatus*, *pRecordset*

## Parameters

  - *fMoreData*

  - A **VARIANT\_BOOL** value that, if set to VARIANT\_TRUE, indicates more rows have been added to the **Recordset**.

  - *adStatus*

  - [EventStatusEnum](eventstatusenum.md)
    
    When **EndOfRecordset** is called, this parameter is set to **adStatusOK** if the operation that caused the event was successful. It is set to **adStatusCantDeny** if this event cannot request cancellation of the operation that caused this event.
    
    Before **EndOfRecordset** returns, set this parameter to **adStatusUnwantedEvent** to prevent subsequent notifications.

  - *pRecordset*

  - A **Recordset** object. The **Recordset** for which this event occurred.

## Remarks

An **EndOfRecordset** event may occur if the [MoveNext](movefirst-movelast-movenext-and-moveprevious-methods-ado.md) operation fails.

This event handler is called when an attempt is made to move past the end of the **Recordset** object, perhaps as a result of calling **MoveNext**. However, while in this event, you could retrieve more records from a database and append them to the end of the **Recordset**. In that case, set *fMoreData* to VARIANT\_TRUE, and return from **EndOfRecordset**. Then call **MoveNext** again to access the newly retrieved records.
