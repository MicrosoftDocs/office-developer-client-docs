# RestoreWindow Macro Action


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

You can use the **RestoreWindow** action to restore a maximized or minimized window to its previous size.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>This action can't be applied to code windows in the Visual Basic Editor. For information about how to affect code windows, see the <STRONG>WindowState</STRONG> property topic.</P>



## Setting

The **RestoreWindow** action doesn't have any arguments.

## Remarks

This action works on the selected object. If an object has been minimized, you can first select it by using the **SelectObject** action and then restore it to its previous size by using the **RestoreWindow** action.

You can use the **MoveAndSizeWindow** action to move or size a window that you have restored.

The **RestoreWindow** action has the same effect as clicking the **Restore** button in the window's upper-right corner or clicking the **Restore** command on the window's **Control** menu.

To run the **RestoreWindow** action in a Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) module, use the **Restore** method of the **DoCmd** object.
