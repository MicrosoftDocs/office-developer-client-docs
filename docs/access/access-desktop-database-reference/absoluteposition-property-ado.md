# AbsolutePosition Property (ADO)


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

Indicates the ordinal position of a [Recordset](recordset-object-ado.md) object's current record.

## Settings and Return Values

Sets or returns a **Long** value from 1 to the number of records in the **Recordset** object ([RecordCount](recordcount-property-ado.md)), or returns one of the [PositionEnum](positionenum.md) values.

## Remarks

In order to set the **AbsolutePosition** property, ADO requires that the OLE DB provider you are using implement the IRowsetLocate interface.

Accessing the **AbsolutePosition** property of a **Recordset** that was opened with either a forward-only or dynamic cursor raises the error **adErrFeatureNotAvailable**. With other cursor types, the correct position will be returned as long as the provider supports the IRowsetScroll interface. If the provider does not support the *IRowsetScroll* interface, the property is set to **adPosUnknown**. See the documentation for your provider to determine whether it supports *IRowsetScroll*.

Use the **AbsolutePosition** property to move to a record based on its ordinal position in the **Recordset** object, or to determine the ordinal position of the current record. The provider must support the appropriate functionality for this property to be available.

Like the [AbsolutePage](absolutepage-property-ado.md) property, **AbsolutePosition** is 1-based and equals 1 when the current record is the first record in the **Recordset**. You can obtain the total number of records in the **Recordset** object from the [RecordCount](recordcount-property-ado.md) property.

When you set the **AbsolutePosition** property, even if it is to a record in the current cache, ADO reloads the cache with a new group of records starting with the record you specified. The [CacheSize](cachesize-property-ado.md) property determines the size of this group.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>You should not use the <STRONG>AbsolutePosition</STRONG> property as a surrogate record number. The position of a given record changes when you delete a preceding record. There is also no assurance that a given record will have the same <STRONG>AbsolutePosition</STRONG> if the <STRONG>Recordset</STRONG> object is requeried or reopened. Bookmarks are still the recommended way of retaining and returning to a given position and are the only way of positioning across all types of <STRONG>Recordset</STRONG> objects.</P>
