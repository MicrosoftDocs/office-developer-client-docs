# Connection Object (ADO)


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

Represents an open connection to a data source.

## Remarks

A **Connection** object represents a unique session with a data source. In the case of a client/server database system, it may be equivalent to an actual network connection to the server. Depending on the functionality supported by the provider, some collections, methods, or properties of a **Connection** object may not be available.

With the collections, methods, and properties of a **Connection** object, you can do the following:

  - Configure the connection before opening it with the [ConnectionString](connectionstring-property-ado.md), [ConnectionTimeout](connectiontimeout-property-ado.md), and [Mode](mode-property-ado.md) properties. **ConnectionString** is the default property of the **Connection** object.

  - Set the [CursorLocation](cursorlocation-property-ado.md) property to client to invoke the [Microsoft Cursor Service for OLE DB](microsoft-cursor-service-for-ole-db-ado-service-component.md), which supports batch updates.

  - Set the default database for the connection with the [DefaultDatabase](defaultdatabase-property-ado.md) property.

  - Set the level of isolation for the transactions opened on the connection with the [IsolationLevel](isolationlevel-property-ado.md) property.

  - Specify an OLE DB provider with the [Provider](provider-property-ado.md) property.

  - Establish, and later break, the physical connection to the data source with the [Open](open-method-ado-connection.md) and [Close](close-method-ado.md) methods.

  - Execute a command on the connection with the [Execute](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/jj249832\(v=office.15\)) method and configure the execution with the [CommandTimeout](commandtimeout-property-ado.md) property.
    

    > [!NOTE]
    > <P>To execute a query without using a Command object, pass a query string to the <STRONG>Execute</STRONG> method of a <STRONG>Connection</STRONG> object. However, a <A href="command-object-ado.md">Command</A> object is required when you want to persist the command text and re-execute it, or use query parameters.</P>



  - Manage transactions on the open connection, including nested transactions if the provider supports them, with the [BeginTrans](begintrans-committrans-and-rollbacktrans-methods-ado.md), [CommitTrans](begintrans-committrans-and-rollbacktrans-methods-ado.md), and [RollbackTrans](begintrans-committrans-and-rollbacktrans-methods-ado.md) methods and the [Attributes](attributes-property-ado.md) property.

  - Examine errors returned from the data source with the [Errors](errors-collection-ado.md) collection.

  - Read the version from the ADO implementation used with the [Version](version-property-ado.md) property.

  - Obtain schema information about your database with the [OpenSchema](openschema-method-ado.md) method.

You can create **Connection** objects independently of any other previously defined object.

You can execute commands or stored procedures as if they were native methods on the **Connection** object, as illustrated below.

**Execute a command as a native method of a Connection object**

To execute a command, give the command a name using the **Command** object [Name](name-property-ado.md) property. Set the **Command** object's **ActiveConnection** property to the connection. Then issue a statement where the command name is used as if it were a method on the **Connection** object, followed by any parameters, then followed by a **Recordset** object if any rows are returned. Set the **Recordset** properties to customize the resulting **Recordset**. For example:

    Dim cnn As New ADODB.Connection
    Dim cmd As New ADODB.Command
    Dim rst As New ADODB.Recordset
    ...
    cnn.Open "..."
    cmd.Name = "yourCommandName"
    cmd.ActiveConnection = cnn
    ...
    'Your command name, any parameters, and an optional Recordset.
    cnn.yourCommandName "parameter", rst

**Execute a stored procedure as a native method of a Connection object**

To execute a stored procedure, issue a statement where the stored procedure name is used as if it were a method on the **Connection** object, followed by any parameters. ADO will make a "best guess" of parameter types. For example:

    Dim cnn As New ADODB.Connection
    ...
    'Your stored procedure name and any parameters.
    cnn.sp_yourStoredProcedureName "parameter"
