# Charset Property (ADO)


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

Indicates the character set into which the contents of a text [Stream](stream-object-ado.md) should be translated for storage in the Stream objects internal buffer.

## Settings and Return Values

Sets or returns a **String** value that specifies the character set into which the contents of the **Stream** will be translated. The default value is "Unicode". Allowed values are typical strings passed over the interface as Internet character set strings (for example, "iso-8859-1", "Windows-1252", etc.). For a list of the character set strings that is known by a system, see the subkeys of HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT\\MIME\\Database\\Charset in the Windows Registry.

## Remarks

In a text **Stream** object, text data is stored in the character set specified by the **Charset** property. The default is Unicode. The **Charset** property is used for converting data going into the **Stream** or coming out of the **Stream**. For example, if the **Stream** contains ISO-8859-1 data and that data is copied to a BSTR, the **Stream** object will convert the data to Unicode. The reverse is also true.

For an open **Stream**, the current [Position](position-property-ado.md) must be at the beginning of the **Stream** (0) to be able to set **Charset**.

**Charset** is used only with text **Stream** objects ([Type](type-property-ado-stream.md) is **adTypeText**). This property is ignored if **Type** is **adTypeBinary**.
