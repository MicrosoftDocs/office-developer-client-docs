# Customizing Windows Registry Settings for the Microsoft Access Database Engine


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

If your application cannot work correctly with the default functionality of the Microsoft Access database engine, you may have to change the settings in the Microsoft® Windows® Registry to suit your needs. The Windows Registry can also be used to tune the operation of the installable ISAM and ODBC driver.

You can customize the settings in the Windows Registry in four different ways:

[Using Regedit.exe to Overwrite the Default Settings](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ff193205\(v=office.15\))

[Creating a Portion in Your Application's Registry Tree to Manage the Settings](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ff836342\(v=office.15\))

[Using the SetOption Method from DAO](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ff194471\(v=office.15\))

[Using the Connection Properties in the Microsoft OLE DB Provider for Access](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ff196356\(v=office.15\))
