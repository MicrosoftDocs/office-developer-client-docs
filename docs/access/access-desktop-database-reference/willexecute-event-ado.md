# WillExecute Event (ADO)


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

**In this article**  
Syntax  
Parameters  
Remarks  

The **WillExecute** event is called just before a pending command executes on a connection.

## Syntax

WillExecute*Source*, *CursorType*, *LockType*, *Options*, *adStatus*, *pCommand*, *pRecordset*, *pConnection*

## Parameters

  - *Source*

  - A **String** that contains an SQL command or a stored procedure name.

  - *CursorType*

  - A [CursorTypeEnum](cursortypeenum.md) that contains the type of cursor for the **Recordset** that will be opened. With this parameter, you can change the cursor to any type during a **Recordset** [Open](open-method-ado-recordset.md) operation. *CursorType* will be ignored for any other operation.

  - *LockType*

  - A [LockTypeEnum](locktypeenum.md) that contains the lock type for the **Recordset** that will be opened. With this parameter, you can change the lock to any type during a **Recordset** **Open** operation. *LockType* will be ignored for any other operation.

  - *Options*

  - A **Long** value that indicates options that can be used to execute the command or open the **Recordset**.

  - *adStatus*

  - [EventStatusEnum](eventstatusenum.md)
    
    Before this event returns, set this parameter to **adStatusUnwantedEvent** to prevent subsequent notifications, or **adStatusCancel** to request cancellation of the operation that caused this event.

  - *pCommand*

  - The [Command](command-object-ado.md) object for which this event notification applies.

  - *pRecordset*

  - The [Recordset](recordset-object-ado.md) object for which this event notification applies.

  - *pConnection*

  - The [Connection](connection-object-ado.md) object for which this event notification applies.

## Remarks

A **WillExecute** event may occur due to a **Connection.**[Execute](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/jj249832\(v=office.15\)), **Command.**[Execute](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/jj248785\(v=office.15\)), or **Recordset.**[Open](open-method-ado-recordset.md) method The *pConnection* parameter should always contain a valid reference to a **Connection** object. If the event is due to **Connection.Execute**, the *pRecordset* and *pCommand* parameters are set to **Nothing**. If the event is due to **Recordset.Open**, the *pRecordset* parameter will reference the **Recordset** object and the *pCommand* parameter is set to **Nothing**. If the event is due to **Command.Execute**, the *pCommand* parameter will reference the **Command** object and the *pRecordset* parameter is set to **Nothing**.

**WillExecute** allows you to examine and modify the pending execution parameters. This event may return a request that the pending command be canceled.
