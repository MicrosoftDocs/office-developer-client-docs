# CursorLocation Property (ADO)


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

Indicates the location of the cursor service.

## Settings And Return Values

Sets or returns a **Long** value that can be set to one of the [CursorLocationEnum](cursorlocationenum.md) values.

## Remarks

This property allows you to choose between various cursor libraries accessible to the provider. Usually, you can choose between using a client-side cursor library or one that is located on the server.

This property setting affects connections established only after the property has been set. Changing the **CursorLocation** property has no effect on existing connections.

Cursors returned by the [Execute](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/jj249832\(v=office.15\)) method inherit this setting. **Recordset** objects will automatically inherit this setting from their associated connections.

This property is read/write on a [Connection](connection-object-ado.md) or a closed [Recordset](recordset-object-ado.md), and read-only on an open **Recordset**.

**Remote Data Service Usage**When used on a client-side **Recordset** or **Connection** object, the **CursorLocation** property can only be set to **adUseClient**.
