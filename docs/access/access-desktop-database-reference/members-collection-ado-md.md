# Members Collection (ADO MD)


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

Contains the [Member](member-object-ado-md.md) objects from a level or a position along an axis.

## Remarks

A **Members** collection is used to contain the following types of members:

  - The members that make up a level in a cube. These are contained in the **Members** collection of a [Level](level-object-ado-md.md) object. For example, using the sample from [Overview of Multidimensional Schemas and Data](overview-of-multidimensional-schemas-and-data.md), the four members of the Countries level are Canada, USA, UK, and Germany.

  - The members that are the children of a specific member within a hierarchy. These members are returned by the [Children](children-property-ado-md.md) property of the parent **Member** object. For example, again using the same sample, the two children of the Canada member are Canada-East and Canada-West.

  - The members that define a specific position along an axis of a [cellset](cellset-object-ado-md.md). Using the cellset from [Working with Multidimensional Data](working-with-multidimensional-data.md) as an example, the two members of the first position on the x-axis are Valentine and Seattle. These members are contained by the **Members** collection of a [Position](position-object-ado-md.md) object.

**Members** is a standard ADO collection. With the properties and methods of a collection, you can do the following:

  - Obtain the number of objects in the collection with the [Count](count-property-ado.md) property.

  - Return an object from the collection with the default [Item](item-property-ado.md) property.

  - Update the objects in the collection from the provider with the [Refresh](refresh-method-ado.md) method.
