# DBEngine.Idle Method (DAO)


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

**In this article**  
Syntax  
Remarks  
Example  

Suspends data processing, enabling the Microsoft Access database engine to complete any pending tasks, such as memory optimization or page timeouts (Microsoft Access workspaces only).

## Syntax

*expression* .Idle(***Action***)

*expression* A variable that represents a **DBEngine** object.

### Parameters

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 25%" />
<col style="width: 25%" />
<col style="width: 25%" />
<col style="width: 25%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><p>Name</p></th>
<th><p>Required/Optional</p></th>
<th><p>Data Type</p></th>
<th><p>Description</p></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Action</p></td>
<td><p>Optional</p></td>
<td><p><strong>Variant</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Specifies the action to take. Can be one of the <strong><a href="idleenum-enumeration-dao.md">IdleEnum</a></strong> constants.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


## Remarks

The **Idle** method allows the Microsoft Access database engine to perform background tasks that may not be up-to-date because of intense data processing. This is often true in multiuser, multitasking environments that don't have enough background processing time to keep all records in a **[Recordset](recordset-object-dao.md)** current.

Usually, read locks are removed and data in local dynaset-type **Recordset** objects are updated only when no other actions (including mouse movements) occur. If you periodically use the **Idle** method, the Microsoft Access database engine can catch up on background processing tasks by releasing unneeded read locks.

Specifying the optional **dbRefreshCache** argument refreshes memory with only the most current data from the database.

You don't need to use this method in single-user environments unless multiple instances of an application are running. The **Idle** method may increase performance in a multiuser environment because it forces the database engine to write data to disk, releasing locks on memory.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>You can also release read locks by making operations part of a transaction.</P>



## Example

This example uses the **Idle** method to ensure that an output procedure is accessing the most current data available from the database. The IdleOutput procedure is required for this procedure to run.

``` 
Sub IdleX() 
 
 Dim dbsNorthwind As Database 
 Dim strCountry As String 
 Dim strSQL As String 
 Dim rstOrders As Recordset 
 
 Set dbsNorthwind = OpenDatabase("Northwind.mdb") 
 
 ' Get name of country from user and build SQL statement 
 ' with it. 
 strCountry = Trim(InputBox("Enter country:")) 
 strSQL = "SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE ShipCountry = '" & _ 
 strCountry & "' ORDER BY OrderID" 
 
 ' Open Recordset object with SQL statement. 
 Set rstOrders = dbsNorthwind.OpenRecordset(strSQL) 
 
 ' Display contents of Recordset object. 
 IdleOutput rstOrders, strCountry 
 
 rstOrders.Close 
 dbsNorthwind.Close 
 
End Sub 
 
Sub IdleOutput(rstTemp As Recordset, strTemp As String) 
 
 ' Call the Idle method to release unneeded locks, force 
 ' pending writes, and refresh the memory with the current 
 ' data in the .mdb file. 
 DBEngine.Idle dbRefreshCache 
 
 ' Enumerate the Recordset object. 
 With rstTemp 
 Debug.Print "Orders from " & strTemp & ":" 
 Debug.Print , "OrderID", "CustomerID", "OrderDate" 
 Do While Not .EOF 
 Debug.Print , !OrderID, !CustomerID, !OrderDate 
 .MoveNext 
 Loop 
 End With 
 
End Sub 
 
```
