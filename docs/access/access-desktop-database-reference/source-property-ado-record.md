# Source Property (ADO Record)


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

Indicates the data source or object represented by the [Record](record-object-ado.md).

## Settings and Return Values

Sets or returns a **Variant** value that indicates the entity represented by the **Record**.

## Remarks

The **Source** property returns the *Source* argument of the **Record** object [Open](open-method-ado-record.md) method. It can contain an absolute or relative URL string. An absolute URL can be used without setting the [ActiveConnection](activeconnection-property-ado.md) property to directly open the **Record** object. An implicit **Connection** object is created in this case.

The **Source** property can also contain a reference to an already open **Recordset**, which opens a **Record** object representing the current row in the **Recordset**.

The **Source** property could also contain a reference to a [Command](command-object-ado.md) object which returns a single row of data from the provider.

If the **ActiveConnection** property is also set, then the **Source** property must point to some object that exists within the scope of that connection. For example, in tree-structured namespaces, if the **Source** property contains an absolute URL, it must point to a node that exists inside the scope of the node identified by the URL in the connection string. If the **Source** property contains a relative URL, then it is validated within the context set by the **ActiveConnection** property.

The **Source** property is read/write while the **Record** object is closed, and is read-only while the **Record** object is open.
