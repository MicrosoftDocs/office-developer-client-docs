# Container Object (DAO)


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

A **Container** object groups similar types of **Document** objects together.

## Remarks

Each **Database** object has a **Containers** collection consisting of built-in **Container** objects. Applications can define their own document types and corresponding containers (Microsoft Access database engine databases only); however, these objects may not always be supported through DAO.

Some of these **Container** objects are defined by the Microsoft Access database engine while others may be defined by other applications. The following table lists the name of each **Container** object defined by the Microsoft Access database engine and what type of information it contains.

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><p>Container name</p></th>
<th><p>Contains information about</p></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Databases</p></td>
<td><p>Saved databases</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Tables</p></td>
<td><p>Saved tables and queries</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Relations</p></td>
<td><p>Saved relationships</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>



> [!NOTE]
> <P>Don't confuse the <STRONG>Container</STRONG> objects listed in the preceding table with the collections of the same name. The Databases <STRONG>Container</STRONG> object refers to all saved database objects, but the <STRONG>Databases</STRONG> collection refers only to database objects that are open in a particular workspace.</P>



Each **Container** object has a **Documents** collection containing **Document** objects that describe instances of built-in objects of the type specified by the **Container**. You typically use a **Container** object as an intermediate link to the information in the **Document** object. You can also use the **Containers** collection to set security for all **Document** objects of a given type.

With an existing **Container** object, you can:

  - Use the **Name** property to return the predefined name of the **Container** object.

  - Use the **Owner** property to set or return the owner of the **Container** object. To set the **Owner** property, you must have write permission for the **Container** object, and you must set the property to the name of an existing **User** or **Group** object.

  - Use the **Permissions** and **UserName** properties to set access permissions for the **Container** object; any **Document** object created in the **Documents** collection of a **Container** object inherits these access permission settings.

Because **Container** objects are built-in, you can't create new **Container** objects or delete existing ones.

To refer to a **Container** object in a collection by its ordinal number or by its **Name** property setting, use any of the following syntax forms:

  - **Containers**(0)

  - **Containers**("*name*")

  - **Containers**\!\[*name*\]

## Example

This example enumerates the **Containers** collection of the Northwind database and the **Properties** collection of each **Container** object in the collection.

    Sub ContainerObjectX() 
     
     Dim dbsNorthwind As Database 
     Dim ctrLoop As Container 
     Dim prpLoop As Property 
     
     Set dbsNorthwind = OpenDatabase("Northwind.mdb") 
     
     With dbsNorthwind 
     
     ' Enumerate Containers collection. 
     For Each ctrLoop In .Containers 
     Debug.Print "Properties of " & ctrLoop.Name _ 
     & " container" 
     
     ' Enumerate Properties collection of each 
     ' Container object. 
     For Each prpLoop In ctrLoop.Properties 
     Debug.Print " " & prpLoop.Name _ 
     & " = " prpLoop 
     Next prpLoop 
     
     Next ctrLoop 
     
     .Close 
     End With 
     
    End Sub
