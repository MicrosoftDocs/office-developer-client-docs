# Configuring Virtual Servers on IIS


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

When creating virtual servers in Internet Information Services 4.0, the following two extra steps are needed in order to configure the virtual server to work with RDS:

1.  When setting up the server, check "Allow Execute Access."

2.  Move msadcs.dll to *vroot*\\msadc, where *vroot* is the home directory of your virtual server.
