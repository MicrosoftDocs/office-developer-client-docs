# Group Object (ADOX)


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

Represents a group account that has access permissions within a secured database.

## Remarks

The [Groups](groups-collection-adox.md) collection of a [Catalog](catalog-object-adox.md) represents all the catalog's group accounts. The **Groups** collection for a [User](user-object-adox.md) represents only the group to which the user belongs.

With the properties, collections, and methods of a **Group** object, you can:

  - Identify the group with the [Name](name-property-adox.md) property.

  - Determine whether a group has read, write, or delete permissions with the [GetPermissions](getpermissions-method-adox.md) and [SetPermissions](setpermissions-method-adox.md) methods.

  - Access the user accounts that have memberships in the group with the [Users](users-collection-adox.md) collection.

  - Access provider-specific properties with the [Properties](properties-collection-ado.md) collection.
