# Recordset2.CacheSize Property (DAO)


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

**In this article**  
Syntax  
Remarks  
Example  

Sets or returns the number of records retrieved from an ODBC data source that will be cached locally. Read/write **Long**.

## Syntax

*expression* .CacheSize

*expression* A variable that represents a **Recordset2** object.

## Remarks

The value of the **CacheSize** property must be between 5 and 1200, but not greater than available memory will allow. A typical value is 100. A setting of 0 turns off caching.

Data caching improves performance if you use **Recordset** objects to retrieve data from a remote server. A cache is a space in local memory that holds the data most recently retrieved from the server; this is useful if users request the data again while the application is running. When users request data, the Microsoft Access database engine checks the cache for the requested data first rather than retrieving it from the server, which takes more time. The cache only saves data that comes from an ODBC data source.

Any Microsoft Access database engine-connected ODBC data source, such as a linked table, can have a local cache. To create the cache, open a **Recordset** object from the remote data source, set the **CacheSize** and **[CacheStart](recordset2-cachestart-property-dao.md)** properties, and then use the **[FillCache](recordset2-fillcache-method-dao.md)** method, or step through the records by using the **Move** methods.

You can base the **CacheSize** property setting on the number of records your application can handle at one time. For example, if you're using a **Recordset** object as the source of the data to be displayed on screen, you could set its **CacheSize** property to 20 to display 20 records at one time.

The Microsoft Access database engine requests records within the cache range from the cache, and it requests records outside the cache range from the server.

Records retrieved from the cache don't reflect concurrent changes that other users made to the source data.

To force an update of all the cached data, set the **CacheSize** property of the **Recordset** object to 0, re-set it to the size of the cache you originally requested, and then use the **FillCache** method.

## Example

This example uses the **CreateTableDef** and **FillCache** methods and the **CacheSize**, **CacheStart** and **SourceTableName** properties to enumerate the records in a linked table twice. Then it enumerates the records twice with a 50-record cache. The example then displays the performance statistics for the uncached and cached runs through the linked table.
