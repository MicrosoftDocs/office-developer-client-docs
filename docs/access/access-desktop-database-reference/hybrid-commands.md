# Hybrid Commands


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

Hybrid commands are partially parameterized commands. For example:

``` 
 
SHAPE {select * from plants} 
 APPEND( {select * from customers where country = ?} 
 RELATE PlantCountry TO PARAMETER 0, 
 PlantRegion TO CustomerRegion ) 
```

The caching behavior for a hybrid command is the same as that of regular parameterized commands.
