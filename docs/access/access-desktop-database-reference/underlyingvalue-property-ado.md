# UnderlyingValue Property (ADO)


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

**In this article**  
Return Value  
Remarks  
Record  

Indicates a [Field](field-object-ado.md) object's current value in the database.

## Return Value

Returns a **Variant** value that indicates the value of the **Field**.

## Remarks

Use the **UnderlyingValue** property to return the current field value from the database. The field value in the **UnderlyingValue** property is the value that is visible to your transaction and may be the result of a recent update by another transaction. This may differ from the [OriginalValue](originalvalue-property-ado.md) property, which reflects the value that was originally returned to the [Recordset](recordset-object-ado.md).

This is similar to using the [Resync](resync-method-ado.md) method, but the **UnderlyingValue** property returns only the value for a specific field from the current record. This is the same value that the [Resync](resync-method-ado.md) method uses to replace the [Value](value-property-ado.md) property.

When you use this property with the **OriginalValue** property, you can resolve conflicts that arise from batch updates.

## Record

For [Record](record-object-ado.md) objects, this property will be empty for fields added before [Update](update-method-ado.md) is called.
