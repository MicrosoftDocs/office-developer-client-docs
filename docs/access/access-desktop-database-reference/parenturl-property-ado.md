# ParentURL Property (ADO)


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

Indicates an absolute URL string that points to the parent [Record](record-object-ado.md) of the current **Record** object.

## Return Value

Returns a **String** value that indicates the URL of the parent **Record**.

## Remarks

The **ParentURL** property depends upon the source used to open the **Record** object. For example, the **Record** may be opened with a source containing a relative path name of a directory referenced by the [ActiveConnection](activeconnection-property-ado.md) property.

Suppose "second" is a folder contained under "first". Open the **Record** object with the following:

    record.ActiveConnection = "https://first"
    record.Open "second"

Now, the value of the **ParentURL** property is **ParentURL** property is "https://first" , the same as **ActiveConnection**.

The source may also be an absolute URL such as, "https://first/second" . The **ParentURL** property is then "https://first" , the level above . The **ParentURL** property is then "https://first" , the level above "second" .

This property may be a null value if:

  - There is no parent for the current object; for example, if the **Record** object represents the root of a directory.

  - The **Record** object represents an entity that cannot be specified with a URL.

This property is read-only.
