# AbsolutePage Property (ADO)


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

Indicates on which page the current record resides.

## Settings and Return Values

Sets or returns a **Long** value from 1 to the number of pages in the [Recordset](recordset-object-ado.md) object ( [PageCount](pagecount-property-ado.md) ), or returns one of the [PositionEnum](positionenum.md) values.

## Remarks

This property can be used to identify the page number on which the current record is located. It uses the [PageSize](pagesize-property-ado.md) property to logically divide the total rowset count of the **Recordset** object into a series of pages, each of which has the number of records equal to **PageSize** (except for the last page, which may have fewer records). The provider must support the appropriate functionality for this property to be available.

When getting or setting the **AbsolutePage** property, ADO uses the [AbsolutePosition](absoluteposition-property-ado.md) property and the [PageSize](pagesize-property-ado.md) property together as follows:

  - To get the **AbsolutePage**, ADO first retrieves the **AbsolutePosition**, and then divides it by the **PageSize**.

  - To set the **AbsolutePage**, ADO moves the **AbsolutePosition** as follows: it multiplies the **PageSize** by the new **AbsolutePage** value and then adds 1 to the value. As a result, the current position in the **Recordset** after successfully setting **AbsolutePage** is, the first record in that page.

Like the **AbsolutePosition** property, **AbsolutePage** is 1-based and equals 1 when the current record is the first record in the **Recordset**. Set this property to move to the first record of a particular page. Obtain the total number of pages from the **PageCount** property.
