# Recordset.ValidationRule Property (DAO)


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

Sets or returns a value that validates the data in a field as it's changed or added to a table (Microsoft Access workspaces only).Read/write **String**.

## Syntax

*expression* .ValidationRule

*expression* A variable that represents a **Recordset** object.

## Remarks

The settings or return values is a **String** that describes a comparison in the form of an SQL WHERE clause without the WHERE reserved word. For an object not yet appended to the **Fields** collection, this property is read/write.

The **ValidationRule** property determines whether or not a field contains valid data. If the data is not valid, a trappable run-time error occurs. The returned error message is the text of the **ValidationText** property, if specified, or the text of the expression specified by **ValidationRule**.

For a **Recordset** object, use of the **ValidationRule** property is read-only. For a **TableDef** object, use of the **ValidationRule** property depends on the status of the **TableDef** object, as the following table shows.

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><p>TableDef</p></th>
<th><p>Usage</p></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p>Base table</p></td>
<td><p>Read/write</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p>Linked table</p></td>
<td><p>Read-only</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


Validation is supported only for databases that use the Microsoft Access database engine.

The string expression specified by the **ValidationRule** property of a **Field** object can refer only to that **Field**. The expression can't refer to user-defined functions, SQL aggregate functions, or queries. To set a **Field** object's **ValidationRule** property when its **ValidateOnSet** property setting is **True**, the expression must successfully parse (with the field name as an implied operand) and evaluate to **True**. If its **ValidateOnSet** property setting is **False**, the **ValidationRule** property setting is ignored.

The **ValidationRule** property of a **Recordset** or **TableDef** object can refer to multiple fields in that object. The restrictions noted earlier in this topic for the **Field** object apply.

For a table-type **Recordset** object, the **ValidationRule** property inherits the **ValidationRule** property setting of the **TableDef** object that you use to create the table-type **Recordset** object.


> [!NOTE]
> <P>If you set the property to a string concatenated with a non-integer value, and the system parameters specify a non-U.S. decimal character such as a comma (for example, strRule = "PRICE &gt; " &amp; lngPrice, and lngPrice = 125,50), an error will result when your code attempts to validate any data. This is because during concatenation, the number will be converted to a string using your system's default decimal character, and Microsoft Access SQL only accepts U.S. decimal characters.</P>
