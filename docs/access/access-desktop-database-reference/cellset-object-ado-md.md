# Cellset Object (ADO MD)


**Applies to**: Access 2013 | Office 2013

Represents the results of a multidimensional query. It is a collection of cells selected from cubes or other cellsets.

## Remarks

Data within a **Cellset** is retrieved using direct, array-like access. You can "drill down" to a specific member to obtain data about that member. For example, the following code returns the caption of the first member in the first position on the first axis of a cellset named cst:

    cst.Axes(0).Positions(0).Members(0).Caption

There is no notion of a current cell within a cellset. Instead, the [Item](item-property-ado-md-cellset.md) property retrieves a specific [Cell](cell-object-ado-md.md) object from the cellset. The arguments of the **Item** property determine which cell is retrieved. You can specify the unique ordinal value of a cell. You can also retrieve cells by using their position numbers along each axis of the cellset. For more information about retrieving cells, see the [Item](item-property-ado-md-cellset.md) property.

With the collections, methods, and properties of a **Cellset** object, you can do the following:

  - Associate an open connection with a **Cellset** object by setting its [ActiveConnection](activeconnection-property-ado-md.md) property.

  - Execute and retrieve the results of a multidimensional query with the [Open](open-method-ado-md.md) method.

  - Retrieve a **Cell** from the **Cellset** with the [Item](item-property-ado-md-cellset.md) property.

  - Return the [Axis](axis-object-ado-md.md) objects that define the **Cellset** with the [Axes](axes-collection-ado-md.md) collection.

  - Retrieve information about the dimensions used to filter the data in the **Cellset** with the [FilterAxis](filteraxis-property-ado-md.md) property.

  - Return or specify the query used to define the **Cellset** with the [Source](source-property-ado-md.md) property.

  - Return the current state of the **Cellset** (open, closed, executing, or connecting) with the [State](state-property-ado-md.md) property.

  - Close an open **Cellset** with the [Close](close-method-ado-md.md) method.

  - Retrieve provider-specific information about the **Cellset** with the standard ADO [Properties](properties-collection-ado.md) collection.
