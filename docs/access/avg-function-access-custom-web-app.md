## Syntax

 **Avg** (*NumericExpression*) 
  
The **Avg** function contains the following argument. 
  
|**Argument**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|NumericExpression  <br/> |A string expression identifying the field that contains the numeric data you want to average or an expression that performs a calculation using the data in that field. Operands in  *NumericExpression*  can include the name of a table field, a variable, or a function (which can be either intrinsic or user-defined but not one of the other SQL aggregate functions).  <br/> |
   
## Remarks

The average calculated by **Avg** is the arithmetic mean (the sum of the values divided by the number of values). You could use **Avg**, for example, to calculate average freight cost. 
  
The **Avg** function does not include any **Null** values in the calculation.
