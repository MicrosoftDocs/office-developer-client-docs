## Syntax

 **OpenPopup** (*View*, *Where=*, *Order By*) 
  
The **OpenPopup** action contains the following arguments. 
  
|**Argument name**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
| *View*  <br/> |The name of the view to open.  <br/> |
| *Where=*  <br/> |A valid SQL WHERE clause (without the word WHERE) that restricts the records in the view.  <br/> |
| *Order By*  <br/> |A string expression that includes the name of the field or fields on which to sort records and the optional ASC or DESC keywords. By default, this argument is blank.  <br/> |
   
## Remarks

The current macro ends once the **OpenPopup** action is processed. 
  
Any sorting or filtering applied by the user is cleared when the **OpenPopup** action is called. 
  
The  *OrderBy*  argument is the name of the field or fields on which you want to sort records. When you use more than one field name, separate the names with a comma (,). 
  
When you set the  *OrderBy*  argument, the records are sorted by default in ascending order.
