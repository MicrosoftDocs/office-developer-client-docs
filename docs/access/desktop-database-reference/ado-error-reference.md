# ADO error reference

**Applies to**: Access 2013, Office 2013

The **ErrorValueEnum** constant describes the ADO error values. For a complete listing of these enumerated constants, including values, see [Appendix B: ADO Errors](appendix-b-ado-errors.md). This section will examine some of the more interesting errors and explain some specific situations that can raise them, or solutions to fix the problem. Both the **ErrorValueEnum** constant and the short positive decimal number are listed.

<td><p><strong>3001</strong></p></td>
<td><p><strong>adErrInvalidArgument</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Arguments are of the wrong type, are out of acceptable range, or are in conflict with one another. This error is often caused by a typographical error in an SQL SELECT statement. For example, a misspelled field name or table name can generate this error. This error can also occur when a field or table named in a SELECT statement does not exist in the data store.</p></td>

<td><p><strong>3002</strong></p></td>
<td><p><strong>adErrOpeningFile</strong></p></td>

<td><p>Either <strong>BOF</strong> or <strong>EOF</strong> is True, or the current record has been deleted. Requested operation requires a current record. An attempt was made to update records by using <strong>Find</strong> or <strong>Seek</strong> to move the record pointer to the desired record. If the record is not found, <strong>EOF</strong> will be True. This error can also occur after a failed <strong>AddNew</strong> or <strong>Delete</strong> because there is no current record when these methods fail.</p></td>

You might have https://mysite/photo/myphoto.jpg when you should actually have https://mysite/photos/myphoto.jpg instead. The typographical error in the parent URL (in this case, <em>photo</em> instead of <em>photos</em>) has caused the error.</p></td>
</tr>

<td><p><strong>3730</strong></p></td>
<td><p><strong>adErrResourceLocked</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Object represented by the specified URL is locked by one or more other processes. Wait until the process has finished and attempt the operation again.

<td><p>Copy operation cannot be performed. Object named by destination URL already exists. Specify <strong>adCopyOverwrite</strong> to replace the object. If you do not specify <strong>adCopyOverwrite</strong> when copying the files in a directory, the copy fails when you try to copy an item that already exists in the destination location.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>3732</strong></p></td>
<td><p><strong>adErrCannotComplete</strong></p></td>

<td><p><strong>adErrVolumeNotFound</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Provider cannot locate the storage device indicated by the URL. Make sure the URL is typed correctly.

</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>3734</strong></p></td>

</tr>
<tr class="even">

<td><p><strong>3749</strong></p></td>
<td><p><strong>adErrFieldsUpdateFailed</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Fields update failed. For further information, examine the <strong>Status</strong> property of individual field objects. This error can occur in two situations: when changing a <strong>Field</strong> object's value in the process of changing or adding a record to the database; and when changing the properties of the <strong>Field</strong> object itself. The <strong>Record</strong> or <strong>Recordset</strong> update failed due to a problem with one of the fields in the current record. Enumerate the <strong>Fields</strong> collection and check the <strong>Status</strong> property of each field to determine the cause of the problem.</p></td>

<td><p><strong>adErrDenyTypeNotSupported</strong></p></td>
