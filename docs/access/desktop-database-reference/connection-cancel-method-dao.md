# Connection.Cancel method (DAO)

**Applies to**: Access 2013, Office 2013

## Syntax

*expression* .Cancel

*expression* A variable that represents a **Connection** object.

## Remarks

Use the **Cancel** method to terminate execution of an asynchronous **Execute** or **OpenConnection** method call (that is, the method was invoked with the dbRunAsync option). **Cancel** will return a run-time error if dbRunAsync was not used in the method you're trying to terminate.

An error will occur if, following a **Cancel** method call, you try to reference the object that would have been created by an asynchronous **OpenConnection** call (that is, the **Connection** object from which you called the **Cancel** method).

## Example

This example uses the **StillExecuting** property and the **Cancel** method to asynchronously open a **Connection** object.

```vb
    Sub CancelConnectionX() 
     
     Dim wrkMain As Workspace 
     Dim conMain As Connection 
     Dim sngTime As Single 
     
     Set wrkMain = CreateWorkspace("ODBCWorkspace", _ 
     "admin", "", dbUseODBC) 
     ' Open the connection asynchronously. 
     
     ' Note: The DSN referenced below must be configured to 
     ' use Microsoft Windows NT Authentication Mode to 
     ' authorize user access to the Microsoft SQL Server. 
     Set conMain = wrkMain.OpenConnection("Publishers", _ 
     dbDriverNoPrompt + dbRunAsync, False, _ 
     "ODBC;DATABASE=pubs;DSN=Publishers") 
     
     sngTime = Timer 
     
     ' Wait five seconds. 
     Do While Timer - sngTime < 5 
     Loop 
     
     ' If the connection has not been made, ask the user 
     ' if she wants to keep waiting. If she does not, cancel 
     ' the connection and exit the procedure. 
     Do While conMain.StillExecuting 
     
     If MsgBox("No connection yet--keep waiting?", _ 
     vbYesNo) = vbNo Then 
     conMain.Cancel 
     MsgBox "Connection cancelled!" 
     wrkMain.Close 
     Exit Sub 
     End If 
     
     Loop 
     
     With conMain 
     ' Use the Connection object conMain. 
     .Close 
     End With 
     
     wrkMain.Close 
     
    End Sub
```
