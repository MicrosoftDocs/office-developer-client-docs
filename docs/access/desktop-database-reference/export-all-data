# Export all data from a Microsoft Access database

**Applies to**: Access 2024, Access 2021 

This topic explains how an IT administrator can export all data and objects from a Microsoft Access database to text files, enabling use with other tools and supporting data portability.

For data stored in Tables, data can be exported to a variety of other formats using Access Wizards, such as Excel, see [Export data to Excel](https://support.microsoft.com/office/export-data-to-excel-64e974e6-ae43-4301-a53e-20463655b1a9), or text, see [Export data to a text file](https://support.microsoft.com/office/export-data-to-a-text-file-f72dfc38-a8a0-4c5b-8c2c-bf2950814140).

The following instructions demonstrate how to export objects using VBA code, using the [DoCmd.TransferText method (Access)](https://learn.microsoft.com/office/vba/api/Access.DoCmd.TransferText) command to export table data, and the [Application.SaveAsText](/application-save-as-text) command for other objects. 

The code provided will create a function that can be called with the full path to a database and a destination folder. It will then create a text file for each object in the database, which will contain the data from tables, and the definitions of all user created objects such as forms or reports.

Since this process uses OLE automation, the code could also be written using PowerShell or using a .NET language such as C#.
