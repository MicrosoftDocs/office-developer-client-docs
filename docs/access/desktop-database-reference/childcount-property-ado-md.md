# ChildCount Property (ADO MD)


**Applies to**: Access 2013, Office 2013

Indicates the number of members for which the current [Member](member-object-ado-md.md) object is the parent in a hierarchy.

## Return Values

Returns a **Long** integer and is read-only.

## Remarks

Use the **ChildCount** property to return an estimate of how many children a **Member** has. The actual children of a **Member** can be returned by the [Children](children-property-ado-md.md) property.

For **Member** objects from a [Position](position-object-ado-md.md) object, the maximum number returned is 65536. If the actual number of children exceeds 65536, the value returned will still be 65536. Therefore, the application should interpret a **ChildCount** of 65536 as equal to or greater than 65536 children.

For **Member** objects from a [Level](level-object-ado-md.md) object, use the ADO collection [Count](count-property-ado.md) property on the **Children** collection to determine the exact number of children. Determining the exact number of children may be slow if the number of children in the collection is large.
