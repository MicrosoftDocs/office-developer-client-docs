# Groups and Users Append, ChangePassword methods example (VB)


**Applies to**: Access 2013, Office 2013

This example demonstrates the [Append](append-method-adox-groups.md) method of [Groups](groups-collection-adox.md), as well as the [Append](append-method-adox-users.md) method of [Users](users-collection-adox.md) by adding a new [Group](group-object-adox.md) and a new [User](user-object-adox.md) to the system. The new **Group** is appended to the **Groups** collection of the new **User**. Consequently, the new **User** is added to the **Group**. Also, the [ChangePassword](changepassword-method-adox.md) method is used to specify the **User** password.
