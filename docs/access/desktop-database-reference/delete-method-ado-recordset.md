# Delete Method (ADO Recordset)


**Applies to**: Access 2013, Office 2013



Deletes the current record or a group of records.

## Syntax

*recordset*.Delete *AffectRecords*

## Parameters

  - *AffectRecords*

  - An [AffectEnum](affectenum.md) value that determines how many records the **Delete** method will affect. The default value is **adAffectCurrent**.


> [!NOTE]
> **adAffectAll** and **adAffectAllChapters** are not valid arguments to **Delete**.

## Remarks

Using the **Delete** method marks the current record or a group of records in a [Recordset](recordset-object-ado.md) object for deletion. If the **Recordset** object doesn't allow record deletion, an error occurs. If you are in immediate update mode, deletions occur in the database immediately. If a record cannot be successfully deleted (due to database integrity violations, for example), the record will remain in edit mode after the call to **Update**. This means that you must cancel the update with [CancelUpdate](cancelupdate-method-ado.md) before moving off the current record (for example, with [Close](close-method-ado.md), [Move](move-method-ado.md), or [NextRecordset](nextrecordset-method-ado.md)).

If you are in batch update mode, the records are marked for deletion from the cache and the actual deletion happens when you call the [UpdateBatch](updatebatch-method-ado.md) method. (Use the [Filter](filter-property-ado.md) property to view the deleted records.)

Retrieving field values from the deleted record generates an error. After deleting the current record, the deleted record remains current until you move to a different record. Once you move away from the deleted record, it is no longer accessible.

If you nest deletions in a transaction, you can recover deleted records with the [RollbackTrans](begintrans-committrans-and-rollbacktrans-methods-ado.md) method. If you are in batch update mode, you can cancel a pending deletion or group of pending deletions with the [CancelBatch](cancelbatch-method-ado.md) method.

If the attempt to delete records fails because of a conflict with the underlying data (for example, a record has already been deleted by another user), the provider returns warnings to the [Errors](errors-collection-ado.md) collection but does not halt program execution. A run-time error occurs only if there are conflicts on all the requested records.

If the [Unique Table](unique-table-unique-schema-unique-catalog-properties-dynamic-ado.md) dynamic property is set, and the **Recordset** is the result of executing a JOIN operation on multiple tables, then the **Delete** method will only delete rows from the table named in the [Unique Table](unique-table-unique-schema-unique-catalog-properties-dynamic-ado.md) property.
