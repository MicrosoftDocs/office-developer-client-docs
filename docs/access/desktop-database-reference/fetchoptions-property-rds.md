# FetchOptions property (RDS)


**Applies to**: Access 2013, Office 2013

Indicates the type of asynchronous fetching.

## Setting and Return Values

Sets or returns one of the following values.

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><p>Constant</p></th>
<th><p>Description</p></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>adcFetchUpFront</strong></p></td>
<td><p>All the records of the <a href="recordset-object-ado.md">Recordset</a> are fetched before control is returned to the application. The complete <strong>Recordset</strong> is fetched before the application is allowed to do anything with it.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><p><strong>adcFetchBackground</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Control can return to the application as soon as the first batch of records has been fetched. A subsequent read of the <strong>Recordset</strong> that attempts to access a record not fetched in the first batch will be delayed until the sought record is actually fetched, at which time control returns to the application.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><p><strong>adcFetchAsync</strong></p></td>
<td><p>Default. Control returns immediately to the application while records are fetched in the background. If the application attempts to read a record that hasn't yet been fetched, the record closest to the sought record will be read and control will return immediately, indicating that the current end of the <strong>Recordset</strong> has been reached. For example, a call to <a href="movefirst-movelast-movenext-and-moveprevious-methods-rds.md">MoveLast</a> will move the current record position to the last record actually fetched, even though more records will continue to populate the <strong>Recordset</strong>.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>



> [!NOTE]
> Each client-side executable file that uses these constants must provide declarations for them. You can cut and paste the constant declarations you want from the file Adcvbs.inc, located in the C:\Program Files\Common Files\System\MSADC folder.



## Remarks

In a web application, you will usually want to use **adcFetchAsync** (the default value), because it provides better performance. In a compiled client application, you will usually want to use **adcFetchBackground**.
