# Navigating through the data

**Applies to**: Access 2013, Office 2013

Now that you have executed a command against the data source and determined that the result set contains data, you can move through the results by using the navigation methods and properties provided by the **Recordset** object. 

The following topics describe how to use these methods and properties on the sample **Recordset**:

- [Jumping to a record](jumping-to-a-record.md)
- [More ways to move in a Recordset](more-ways-to-move-in-a-recordset.md)
- [Using bookmarks](using-bookmarks.md)
- [Using pages](using-pages.md)
- [Recordset positioning](recordset-positioning.md)
