# Fabricating hierarchical Recordsets


**Applies to**: Access 2013, Office 2013

The following example shows how to fabricate a hierarchical Recordset without an underlying data source by using the data shaping grammar to define columns for parent, child, and grandchild **Recordsets**.

To fabricate a hierarchical **Recordset**, you must specify the Microsoft Data Shaping Service for OLE DB (MSDataShape), and you may specify a Data Provider value of NONE in the connection string parameter of the [Connection](connection-object-ado.md) object's [Open](open-method-ado-connection.md) method. For more information, see [Required Providers for Data Shaping](required-providers-for-data-shaping.md).

```vb
    Dim cn As New ADODB.Connection
    Dim rsCustomers As New ADODB.Recordset
    
    cn.Open "Provider=MSDataShape;Data Provider=NONE;"
     
    strShape = _
    "SHAPE APPEND NEW adInteger AS CustID," & _
                " NEW adChar(25) AS FirstName," & _
                " NEW adChar(25) AS LastName," & _
                " NEW adChar(12) AS SSN," & _
                " NEW adChar(50) AS Address," & _
             " ((SHAPE APPEND NEW adChar(80) AS VIN_NO," & _
                            " NEW adInteger AS CustID," & _
                            " NEW adChar(20) AS BodyColor, " & _
                         " ((SHAPE APPEND NEW adChar(80) AS VIN_NO," & _
                                        " NEW adChar(20) AS Make, " & _
                                        " NEW adChar(20) AS Model," & _
                                        " NEW adChar(4) AS Year) " & _
                            " AS VINS RELATE VIN_NO TO VIN_NO))" & _
                " AS Vehicles RELATE CustID TO CustID) "
     
    rsCustomers.Open strShape, cn, adOpenStatic, adLockOptimistic, -1
```

After the **Recordset** has been fabricated, it can be populated, manipulated, or persisted to a file.
