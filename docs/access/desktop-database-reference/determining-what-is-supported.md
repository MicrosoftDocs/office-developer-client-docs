# Determining what is supported

**Applies to**: Access 2013, Office 2013

The **Supports** method is used to determine whether a specified **Recordset** object supports a particular type of functionality. It has the following syntax:

`boolean = recordset.Supports( CursorOptions )`

**Supports** returns a Boolean value that indicates whether all of the features identified by the *CursorOptions* argument are supported by the provider. You can use the **Supports** method to determine what types of functionality a **Recordset** object supports. If the **Recordset** object supports the features whose corresponding constants are in *CursorOptions*, the **Supports** method returns **True**. Otherwise, it returns **False**.

Using the **Supports** method, you can check for the ability of the **Recordset** object to add new records, use bookmarks, use the **Find** method, use scrolling, use the **Index** property, and to perform batch updates. For a complete list of constants and their meanings, see [CursorOptionEnum](cursoroptionenum.md).

Although the **Supports** method may return **True** for a given functionality, it does not guarantee that the provider can make the feature available under all circumstances. The **Supports** method simply returns whether the provider can support the specified functionality, assuming certain conditions are met. For example, the **Supports** method may indicate that a **Recordset** object supports updates, even though the cursor is based on a multiple table join — some columns of which are not updateable.
