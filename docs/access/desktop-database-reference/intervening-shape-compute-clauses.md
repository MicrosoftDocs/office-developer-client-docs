# Intervening Shape COMPUTE clauses


**Applies to**: Access 2013, Office 2013

It is valid to embed one or more COMPUTE clauses between the parent and child in a parameterized shape command, as in the following example:

```vb 
 
SHAPE {select au_lname, state from authors} APPEND 
 ((SHAPE 
 (SHAPE 
 {select * from authors where state = ?} rs 
 COMPUTE rs, ANY(rs.state) state, ANY(rs.au_lname) au_lname 
 BY au_id) rs2 
 COMPUTE rs2, ANY(rs2.state) BY au_lname) 
RELATE state TO PARAMETER 0)
