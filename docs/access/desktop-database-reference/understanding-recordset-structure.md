# Understanding Recordset Structure

**Applies to**: Access 2013, Office 2013

Every **Recordset** has a **Fields** collection consisting of one or more **Field** objects. A **Field** object usually represents a table column. 

The following topics explain how to navigate through the **Fields** collection and get information about each field. They then discuss what kind of information is available to you via the **Field** object and how to use it.

- [The Fields Collection](the-fields-collection.md)

- [The Field Object](the-field-object.md)

- [Working with Recordsets](working-with-recordsets.md)
