# Recordset2.NoMatch property (DAO)

**Applies to**: Access 2013, Office 2013

Indicates whether a particular record was found by using the **[Seek](recordset2-seek-method-dao.md)** method or one of the **[Find](recordset2-findfirst-method-dao.md)** methods (Microsoft Access workspaces only).

## Syntax

*expression* .NoMatch

*expression* A variable that represents a **Recordset2** object.

## Remarks

When you open or create a **[Recordset](recordset-object-dao.md)** object, its **NoMatch** property is set to **False**.

To locate a record, use the **Seek** method on a table-type **Recordset** object or one of the **Find** methods on a dynaset- or snapshot-type **Recordset** object. Check the **NoMatch** property setting to see whether the record was found.

If the **Seek** or **Find** method is unsuccessful and the **NoMatch** property is **True**, the current record will no longer be valid. Be sure to obtain the current record's bookmark before using the **Seek** method or a **Find** method if you'll need to return to that record.

> [!NOTE]
> Using any of the **[Move](recordset-movefirst-method-dao.md)** methods on a **Recordset** object won't affect its **NoMatch** property setting.

## Example

This example uses the **NoMatch** property to determine whether a **Seek** and a **FindFirst** were successful, and if not, to give appropriate feedback. The SeekMatch and FindMatch procedures are required for this procedure to run.

```vb
