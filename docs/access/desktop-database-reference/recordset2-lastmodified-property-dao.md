# Recordset2.LastModified Property (DAO)


**Applies to**: Access 2013, Office 2013

Returns a ookmark indicating the most recently added or changed record.

## Syntax

*expression* .LastModified

*expression* A variable that represents a **Recordset2** object.

## Remarks

You can use the **LastModified** property to move to the most recently added or updated record. Use the **LastModified** property with table- and dynaset-type **[Recordset](recordset-object-dao.md)** objects. A record must be added or modified in the **Recordset** object itself in order for the **LastModified** property to have a value.

## Example

This example uses the **LastModified** property to move the current record pointer to both a record that has been modified and a newly created record.

```vb
    Sub LastModifiedX() 
     
     Dim dbsNorthwind As Database 
     Dim rstEmployees As Recordset2 
     Dim strFirst As String 
     Dim strLast As String 
     
     Set dbsNorthwind = OpenDatabase("Northwind.mdb") 
     Set rstEmployees = _ 
     dbsNorthwind.OpenRecordset("Employees", _ 
     dbOpenDynaset) 
     
     With rstEmployees 
     ' Store current data. 
     strFirst = !FirstName 
     strLast = !LastName 
     ' Change data in current record. 
     .Edit 
     !FirstName = "Julie" 
     !LastName = "Warren" 
     .Update 
     ' Move current record pointer to the most recently 
     ' changed or added record. 
     .Bookmark = .LastModified 
     Debug.Print _ 
     "Data in LastModified record after Edit: " & _ 
     !FirstName & " " & !LastName 
     
     ' Restore original data because this is a demonstration. 
     .Edit 
     !FirstName = strFirst 
     !LastName = strLast 
     .Update 
     
     ' Add new record. 
     .AddNew 
     !FirstName = "Roger" 
     !LastName = "Harui" 
     .Update 
     ' Move current record pointer to the most recently 
     ' changed or added record. 
     .Bookmark = .LastModified 
     Debug.Print _ 
     "Data in LastModified record after AddNew: " & _ 
     !FirstName & " " & !LastName 
     
     ' Delete new record because this is a demonstration. 
     .Delete 
     .Close 
     End With 
     
     dbsNorthwind.Close 
     
    End Sub 
```

<br/>

This example uses the **AddNew** method to create a new record with the specified name. The AddName function is required for this procedure to run.

```vb
    Sub AddNewX() 
     
     Dim dbsNorthwind As Database 
     Dim rstEmployees As Recordset2 
     Dim strFirstName As String 
     Dim strLastName As String 
     
     Set dbsNorthwind = OpenDatabase("Northwind.mdb") 
     Set rstEmployees = _ 
     dbsNorthwind.OpenRecordset("Employees", dbOpenDynaset) 
     
     ' Get data from the user. 
     strFirstName = Trim(InputBox( _ 
     "Enter first name:")) 
     strLastName = Trim(InputBox( _ 
     "Enter last name:")) 
     
     ' Proceed only if the user actually entered something 
     ' for both the first and last names. 
     If strFirstName <> "" and strLastName <> "" Then 
     
     ' Call the function that adds the record. 
     AddName rstEmployees, strFirstName, strLastName 
     
     ' Show the newly added data. 
     With rstEmployees 
     Debug.Print "New record: " & !FirstName & _ 
     " " & !LastName 
     ' Delete new record because this is a demonstration. 
     .Delete 
     End With 
     
     Else 
     Debug.Print _ 
     "You must input a string for first and last name!" 
     End If 
     
     rstEmployees.Close 
     dbsNorthwind.Close 
     
    End Sub 
     
    Function AddName(rstTemp As Recordset, _ 
     strFirst As String, strLast As String) 
     
     ' Adds a new record to a Recordset using the data passed 
     ' by the calling procedure. The new record is then made 
     ' the current record. 
     With rstTemp 
     .AddNew 
     !FirstName = strFirst 
     !LastName = strLast 
     .Update 
     .Bookmark = .LastModified 
     End With 
     
    End Function
```
