# Parameterized Commands with Intervening COMPUTE Commands


**Applies to**: Access 2013, Office 2013

A typical parameterized shape APPEND command has a clause that creates a parent **Recordset** with a query command and another clause that creates a child **Recordset** with a parameterized query command — that is, a command containing a parameter placeholder (a question mark, "?"). The resulting shaped **Recordset** has two levels, in which the parent occupies the upper level and the child occupies the lower level.

The clause that creates the child **Recordset** may now be an arbitrary number of nested shape COMPUTE commands, where the most deeply nested command contains the parameterized query. The resulting shaped **Recordset** has multiple levels, in which the parent occupies the uppermost level, the child occupies the lowermost level, and an arbitrary number of **Recordset**s generated by the shape COMPUTE commands occupy the intervening levels.

The typical use for this feature is to invoke the aggregate function and grouping abilities of shape COMPUTE commands to create intervening **Recordset** objects with analytical information about the child **Recordset**. Furthermore, because this is a parameterized shape command, each time a chapter column of the parent is accessed, a new child **Recordset** may be retrieved. Because the intervening levels are derived from the child, they also will be recomputed.
