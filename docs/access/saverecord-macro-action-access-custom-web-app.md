# SaveRecord Macro Action (Access custom web app)

Saves the current record.
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft no longer recommends creating and using Access web apps in SharePoint. As an alternative, consider using [Microsoft PowerApps](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/) to build no-code business solutions for the web and mobile devices. 
  
## Remarks

The **SaveRecord** action is equivalent to using the **Save** button in the action bar to save the current record.
