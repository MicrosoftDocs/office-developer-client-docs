> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft no longer recommends creating and using Access web apps in SharePoint. As an alternative, consider using [Microsoft PowerApps](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/) to build no-code business solutions for the web and mobile devices. 
  
## Syntax

`>= (Greater Than or Equal To)`

*expression*  \>=  *expression* 
  
*expression*  Is any valid expression. Both expressions must have implicitly convertible data types. The conversion depends on the rules of data type precedence. 
  
## Return Type

**Boolean**
  
## Remarks

When you compare non-null expressions, the result is TRUE if the left operand has a greater or equal value than the right operand; otherwise, the result is FALSE.
