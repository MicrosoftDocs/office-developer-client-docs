# fExit

 **Applies to**: Excel 2013 | Office 2013 | Visual Studio 
  
Example user-defined command that unloads GENERIC.xll. When GENERIC.xll is loaded, it creates a user-defined menu, Generic, through which this command is accessed. 
  
```cs
int WINAPI fExit(void);
```

## Parameters

The function takes no parameters.
  
## Property Value/Return Value

The function always returns 1.
  
## Remarks

This is a user-initiated routine to exit GENERIC.xll You should avoid simply calling  `UNREGISTER("GENERIC.XLL")` in this function. This would forcefully unregister all the functions in this DLL, even if they are registered somewhere else. Instead, unregister the functions one at a time. 
  
### Example

See  `\SAMPLES\GENERIC\GENERIC.C` for the source code for this function.
