# Welcome to the Excel Software Development Kit

 * **Applies to:** Excel 2013 | Office 2013 | Visual Studio * 
  
Welcome to the Excel 2013 XLL Software Development Kit (SDK) documentation. This reference contains conceptual overviews, programming tasks, and samples to help you develop Microsoft Excel 2013 XLLs.
  
Revised: November 2012
  
Download the [Excel 2013 XLL SDK](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=251082&amp;clcid=0x409).
  
The Excel 2013 XLL SDK includes the following:
  
- **C application programming interface (API)**—Includes header and source files that enable DLLs to access Excel 2013 functionality, and a description of the interface that a DLL should expose to work with the Excel Add-in Manager.
    
- **Microsoft Visual Studio projects**—Includes C/C++ source code and shows how to use the C API. These sample projects provide examples and they serve as a starting point for your own add-in development.
    
The SDK documentation contains the following sections:
  
- [Getting Started with the Excel XLL SDK](getting-started-with-the-excel-xll-sdk.md)
    
- [Developing Excel XLLs](developing-excel-xlls.md)
    
- [Developing Excel Cluster Connectors](developing-excel-cluster-connectors.md)
    
- [Excel XLL SDK API Function Reference](excel-xll-sdk-api-function-reference.md)
    
## Functionality Not Covered

The following subjects are not covered:
  
- Developing user-defined functions and commands in Excel macro (XLM) sheets.
    
- Creating user-defined functions in DLLs that control the flow of execution of an XLM macro.
    
    Such functions work by returning a special flow control data type, which is also not described in this documentation.
