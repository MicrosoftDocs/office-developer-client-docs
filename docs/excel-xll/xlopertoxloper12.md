# XLOperToXLOper12

 **Applies to**: Excel 2013 | Office 2013 | Visual Studio 
  
Conversion routine used to convert from the old **XLOPER** to the new **XLOPER12**.
  
```cs
BOOL XLOperToXLOper12(LPXLOPER pxloper, LPXLOPER12 pxloper12);
```

## Parameters

 _pxloper_ ( **LPXLOPER**)
  
Pointer to the source **XLOPER** to be converted. 
  
 _pxloper12_ ( **LPXLOPER12**)
  
Pointer to the target **XLOPER12** to contain the converted value. 
  
## Property Value/Return Value

 **TRUE** if the conversion succeeded, **FALSE** otherwise. 
  
## Remarks

Depending on the type of the **XLOPER**, this function allocates a new memory buffer for the converted values, which are pointed to in the target **XLOPER12**. The caller is responsible for freeing any memory associated with the copy if the conversion is a success; **FreeXLOper12T** can be used, or it can be done directly using **free**.
  
If the conversion fails, the caller does not need to free any memory.
  
In general, conversion from any **XLOPER** to an **XLOPER12** is possible. In contrast, conversion from an **XLOPER12** to an **XLOPER** can fail when the **XLOPER12** contains an array or reference that is too large or a string that is too long for the **XLOPER** to contain. 
  
 **XLOPER** ASCII byte strings are converted to **XLOPER12** Unicode wide-character strings in a way that is locale-dependent. 
  
### Example

See the file  `\SAMPLES\FRAMEWRK\FRAMEWRK.C` for the code for this function.
