# Essential and Useful C API XLM Functions

 **Applies to**: Excel 2013 | Office 2013 | Visual Studio 
  
The functions described in this section are Microsoft Excel callback functions that are particularly useful to DLL and XLL developers. Of these, the **xlfRegister** function is essential for XLLs and DLLs that want to register their functions and commands so that they can be called directly from Excel. The functions **xlfUnregister** and **xlfSetName** are used in combination to unregister DLL and XLL functions and commands. 
  
Many more functions are exposed by Excel via the C API that are useful when you are developing XLLs. They correspond to the Excel worksheet functions and functions and commands that are available from XLM macro sheets.
