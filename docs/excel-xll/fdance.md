# fDance

 **Applies to**: Excel 2013 | Office 2013 | Visual Studio 
  
Example user-defined command that changes the selected cells on the active worksheet around until the user presses **ESC**. When GENERIC.xll is loaded, it creates a user-defined menu, Generic, through which this command is accessed.
  
```cs
int WINAPI fDance(void);
```

## Parameters

The function takes no parameters.
  
## Property Value/Return Value

The function always returns 1.
  
## Remarks

This is an example of a lengthy operation. It calls the function [xlAbort](xlabort.md) occasionally. This yields the processor (helping with cooperative multitasking), and checks whether the user has pressed **ESC** to cancel the operation. If so, it offers the user a chance to cancel the abort. 
  
### Example

See  `\SAMPLES\GENERIC\GENERIC.C` for the source code for this function.
