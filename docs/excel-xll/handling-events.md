# Handling Events

 **Applies to**: Excel 2013 | Office 2013 | Visual Studio 
  
Starting in Excel 2010, XLLs can receive events designed to manage the asynchronous function life cycle. The events are as follows:
  
- **CalculationEnded**: Raised when Excel is finished calculating. After this event, you can free resources allocated during the calculation.
    
- **CalculationCanceled**: Raised when the user interrupts the calculation. The XLL stops any asynchronous activities. Immediately following this event, the **CalculationEnded** event is raised. 
    
To handle these events, the XLL uses the C API function [xlEventRegister](xleventregister.md). 
  
> [!NOTE]
> **CalculationEnded** and **CalculationCanceled** are not raised during programmatic recalculation.
