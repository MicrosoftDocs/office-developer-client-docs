# xlAutoAdd

 **Applies to**: Excel 2013 | Office 2013 | Visual Studio 
  
Added by Microsoft Excel whenever the user activates the XLL during an Excel session by using the Add-In Manager. This function is not called when Excel starts up and loads a pre-installed add-in.
  
This function can be used to display a custom dialog box that tells the user that the add-in has been activated, or to read from or write to the registry, or check licensing information, for example.
  
Excel does not require an XLL to implement and export this function.
  
```cs
int WINAPI xlAutoAdd(void);
```

## Parameters

This function takes no arguments.
  
## Property Value/Return Value

Your implementation of this function should return 1. ( **int**).
  
## Remarks

Use this function if there is anything your XLL needs to do when it is added by the Add-In Manager.
  
## Example

See  `\SAMPLES\EXAMPLE\EXAMPLE.C` and  `\SAMPLES\GENERIC\GENERIC.C` for example implementations of this function. The following code is from  `\SAMPLES\EXAMPLE\EXAMPLE.C`.
  
```cs
int WINAPI xlAutoAdd(void)
{
    XCHAR szBuf[255];
    wsprintfW((LPWSTR)szBuf, L"Thank you for adding Example.XLL\n"
            L"build date %hs, time %hs",__DATE__, __TIME__);
/* Display a dialog indicating that the XLL was successfully added */
    Excel12f(xlcAlert, 0, 2, TempStr12(szBuf), TempInt12(2));
    return 1;
}
```
