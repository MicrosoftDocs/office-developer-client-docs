# Displaying Dialog Boxes from Within a DLL or XLL

 **Applies to**: Excel 2013 | Office 2013 | Visual Studio 
  
To display a Win32 dialog box using, for example, the Windows SDK function **DialogBox**, you must first obtain the full 32-bit instance and main window handles for Excel. For more information, see [Access Excel Instance and Main Window Handles](how-to-access-excel-instance-and-main-window-handles.md). 
  
Assuming your project contains the dialog box resource, you must take several steps to set the message-handling routine to that of the newly displayed dialog box and to restore the Excel message handling routine when the dialog box is closed. The example command [fShowDialog](fshowdialog.md) in the Generic project demonstrates the use of the Windows functions to do this correctly. 
  
You can also display dialog boxes using the C API without having to use Windows SDK functions. However, the dialog box capabilities of the C API are very limited compared with those of Windows, Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), or the Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC). (For example, C API dialog boxes are always modal).
