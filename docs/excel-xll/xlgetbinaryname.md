# xlGetBinaryName

 **Applies to**: Excel 2013 | Office 2013 | Visual Studio 
  
Used to return a handle for data saved by the [xlDefineBinaryName function](xldefinebinaryname.md). Data with a defined binary name is saved with the workbook and can be accessed by name at any time. For more information, see "Binary name Scope Limitation" in [Known Issues in Excel XLL Development](known-issues-in-excel-xll-development.md).
  
```cs
Excel12(xlGetBinaryName, LPXLOPER12 pxRes, 1, LPXLOPER12 pxName);
```

## Parameters

 _pxRes_ ( **xltypeBigData** or **xltypeErr**)
  
Bigdata structure specifying the retrieved data or an error is the data could not be retrieved or the name is not defined. When the function returns, the **hdata** member of the **XLOPER**/ **XLOPER12** contains a handle for the named data.  _pxRes_ should be freed in a call to **xlFree** when no longer required. 
  
 _pxName_ ( **xltypeStr**)
  
A string specifying the name of the data.
  
## Remarks

Microsoft Excel owns the memory handle returned in **hdata**. In Windows, the handle is a global memory handle (allocated by the **GlobalAlloc** function).
