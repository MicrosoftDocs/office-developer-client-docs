# xlDefineBinaryName

 **Applies to**: Excel 2013 | Office 2013 | Visual Studio 
  
Used to allocate persistent storage for an **xltypeBigData** **XLOPER**/ **XLOPER12**. Data with a defined binary name is saved with the workbook, and can be accessed by name at any time. For more information, see "Binary Name Scope Limitation" in [Known Issues in Excel XLL Development](known-issues-in-excel-xll-development.md).
  
```cs
Excel12(xlDefineBinaryName, 0, 2, LPXLOPER12 pxName, LPXLOPER12 pxData);
```

## Parameters

 _pxName_ ( **xltypeStr**)
  
A string specifying the name of the data. The string is subject to the same naming restrictions as defined names.
  
 _pxData_ ( **xltypeBigData**)
  
Bigdata structure specifying the data to be stored. When you call this function, the **lpbData** member of the **bigdata** structure should point to the data for which the name is being defined, and the **cbData** member should contain the length of the data in bytes. 
  
If the  _pxData_ argument is not specified ( **xltypeMissing**), the named allocation specified by  _pxName_ is deleted.
