# Using CSISyncClient to control the Office Document Cache (ODC)

Learn how to use CSISyncClient to control the Office Document Cache (ODC).
  
CSISyncClient is an out-of-proc COM server (CsiSyncClient.exe) that allows Microsoft OneDrive to control the behavior of the Office Document Cache (ODC). For example, OneDrive may call upon the ODC via CSISyncClient to upload and download files to and from MS-FSSHTTP enabled endpoints. This enables advanced service-backed features in Office, such as co-authoring and seamless transitions from offline to online.
  
CsiSyncClient is available in Office Desktop (both x86 and x64). Note: While newer versions of Office may ship with CsiSyncClient, the process will be used for backward compatibility only. The CsiSyncClient interface and the methodology of controlling the ODC will change in future versions of Office.
  
The class ID is currently set to respond only to OneDrive.
  
The COM object is usable as an out-of-proc COM server and runs in CsiSyncClient.exe. Due to limitations with Access (which the ODC uses), it ships with the bit type that Office comes in, so x64 Office means an x64 COM object, or x86 Office means an x86 COM object. To get around this limitation, specifying CLSCTX_LOCAL_SERVER as part of the CoCreateInstance will have the COM object be hosted as an out-of-proc COM server, allowing cross-bitness compatibility.
  
## Interfaces

CSISyncClient uses the following interfaces.
  
### Interface ILSCLocalSyncClient

This is the primary interface used to synchronize files in Office.
  
- ProgID: Office.LocalSyncClient
- CLSID: {14286318-B6CF-49a1-81FC-D74AD94902F9}
- TypeLib: {66CDD37F-D313-4e81-8C31-4198F3E42C3C}
   
The COM object that is exposed is used as an out-of-proc server. Specifying CLSCTX_LOCAL_SERVER as part of CoCreateInstance allows compatability between 64bit and 32bit processes.
  
Once you've co-created the COM object, you MUST call [ILSCLocalSyncClient::Initialize ](using-csisyncclient-to-control-the-office-document-cache-odc.md#ILSCLocalSyncClient_Initialize) first. Once [ILSCLocalSyncClient::Initialize ](using-csisyncclient-to-control-the-office-document-cache-odc.md#ILSCLocalSyncClient_Initialize) has completed successfully, you may call any API as often as you wish and in any order. You may also call [ILSCLocalSyncClient::Initialize ](using-csisyncclient-to-control-the-office-document-cache-odc.md#ILSCLocalSyncClient_Initialize) on an already initialized object, but this does nothing. 
  
The exceptions to the previous paragraph are [ILSCLocalSyncClient::ResetCache ](using-csisyncclient-to-control-the-office-document-cache-odc.md#ILSCLocalSyncClient_ResetCache) and [ILSCLocalSyncClient::Uninitialize ](using-csisyncclient-to-control-the-office-document-cache-odc.md#ILSCLocalSyncClient_Uninitialize). After you call [ILSCLocalSyncClient::Uninitialize ](using-csisyncclient-to-control-the-office-document-cache-odc.md#ILSCLocalSyncClient_Uninitialize) on the COM object, you MUST destroy that object and create a new one. [ILSCLocalSyncClient::ResetCache ](using-csisyncclient-to-control-the-office-document-cache-odc.md#ILSCLocalSyncClient_ResetCache) will delete your subcache, delete all associated file information in the cache, but leave the documents on disk. It also leaves the state intact for communicating with the cache. This allows you to call [ILSCLocalSyncClient::Initialize ](using-csisyncclient-to-control-the-office-document-cache-odc.md#ILSCLocalSyncClient_Initialize) again to create a new cache without having to destroy and recreate the COM object. 
  
**Public member functions**

#### ILSCLocalSyncClient::DeleteFile

DeleteFile is used to remove the file information from the cache. However, this method will leave the associated file on disk and on the server.
  
`HRESULT ILSCLocalSyncClient::DeleteFile ([in] BSTR bstrResourceID)`

##### Parameters

 _bstrResourceID_
  
The string which identifies the ResourceID of the file. This value must be non-empty with a maximum of 128 characters. 
  
##### Return values

|Value|Description|
|:-----|:-----|
|E_FAIL  <br/> |The call failed.  <br/> |
|E_INVALIDARG  <br/> |One or more parameters are invalid.  <br/> |
|E_FAIL  <br/> |The call failed.  <br/> |
|E_LSC_FILENOTFOUND  <br/> |The given ResourceID is not in the cache.  <br/> |
|E_LSC_NOTINITIALIZED  <br/> |Initialize has not been successfully called in the past.  <br/> |
|E_LSC_PENDINGCHANGESINCACHE  <br/> |The file is currently synchronizing or open and cannot be deleted.  <br/> |
|S_OK  <br/> |The call succeeded.  <br/> |
   
#### ILSCLocalSyncClient::GetChanges
<a name="ILSCLocalSyncClient_GetChanges"> </a>

GetChanges returns an enumerator of ILSCEvent objects, and also returns a token that is given to the next call to GetChanges, assuming the consumer has processed the previous set of events. Events before the  _nPreviousChangesToken_ specified will be deleted and unavailable. If there are no events to be processed,  _pnCurrentChangesToken_ should be the same value as  _nPreviousChangesToken_, but  _ppiEvents_ will still be set. 
  
`HRESULT ILSCLocalSyncClient::GetChanges ([in] LONG nPreviousChangesToken, [out] LONG * pnCurrentChangesToken, [out] IEnumLSCEvent ** ppiEvents)`

##### Parameters

 _nPreviousChangesToken_
  
Identifies which event was last processed by the consumer. 
  
 _pnCurrentChangesToken_
  
Identifies the most recent event being handed to the consumer. Must not be null.
  
 _ppiEvents_
  
An enumerator for the events handed to the consumer. Must not be null.

|S_OK  <br/> |The call succeeded.  <br/> |
   
#### ILSCLocalSyncClient::GetClientNetworkSyncPermission

GetClientNetworkSyncPermission is used to query whether Office's synchronizing heuristics for network cost and power usage are overridden. When on a 3G or other high cost network, or when running on battery versus being plugged in, Office may choose to block network traffic until a more opportune time.
  
`HRESULT ILSCLocalSyncClient::GetClientNetworkSyncPermission ([in] LSCNetworkSyncPermissionType nspType, [out] VARIANT_BOOL * pfSyncEnabled)`

##### Parameters

 _nspType_
  
A flag which defines which cost heuristic to query. See [Enum LSCNetworkSyncPermissionType](using-csisyncclient-to-control-the-office-document-cache-odc.md#Enum_LSCNetworkSyncPermissionType).

|S_OK  <br/> |The call succeeded.  <br/> |
   
#### ILSCLocalSyncClient::GetFileStatus

GetFileStatus is used to gather information for a specific file: whether it exists in the cache, if it has pending communication with the server copy, and if Office 2013 has the most up to date data from the local copy. It requires a bitwise flag of [Enum LSCStatusFlag](using-csisyncclient-to-control-the-office-document-cache-odc.md#Enum_LSCStatusFlag) values to determine what information the CsiSyncClient COM object is to query for. 
  
`HRESULT ILSCLocalSyncClient::GetFileStatus ([in] BSTR bstrResourceID, [in] LSCStatusFlag sfRequestedStatus, [out] BSTR * pbstrFileSystemPath, [out] BSTR * pbstrETag, [out] LSCStatusFlag * psfFileStatus)`

|S_OK  <br/> |The call succeeded.  <br/> |
   
#### ILSCLocalSyncClient::Initialize
<a name="ILSCLocalSyncClient_Initialize"> </a>

Initialize must be the first method called. Otherwise, all other APIs will return E_LSC_NOTINITIALIZED. Calling Initialize on an already initialized object returns S_OK and does nothing. If E_LSC_CACHEMISMATCH is returned, the caller may call [ILSCLocalSyncClient::ResetCache ](using-csisyncclient-to-control-the-office-document-cache-odc.md#ILSCLocalSyncClient_ResetCache) to delete the cache associated with the given SuppliedID. However, in this case other APIs will still return E_LSC_NOTINITIALIZED. 
  
`HRESULT ILSCLocalSyncClient::Initialize ([in] BSTR bstrSuppliedID, [in] BSTR bstrProgID, [in] BSTR bstrFileSystemDirectoryHint, [in] IPartnerActivityCallback * pEventCallback, [out] VARIANT_BOOL * pfCreatedNewCache)`

##### Parameters

 _bstrSuppliedID_
  
Identifies the consumer and which cache to use. Must be non-empty with a maximum of 32 characters. 
  
 _bstrProgID_
  
Identifies the consumer's COM object for two-way communication. Must be non-empty with a maximum of 39 characters. See [\<ProgID\> Key](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms690196.aspx.aspx) for more information on ProgIDs. 
  
 _bstrFileSystemDirectoryHint_
  
Identifies the directory root in which local files will be stored. Must be non-empty with a maximum of 256 characters. The directory must already exist. 
  
 _pEventCallback_
  
The callback interface which CsiSyncClient will notify on changes. See IPartnerActivityCallback::EventOccurred. This value must not be null. 
  
 _pfCreatedNewCache_
  
Returns whether a new cache was created. If no cache is associated with the SuppliedID, one will be created. This value must not be null.
  
##### Return values

|Value|Description|
|:-----|:-----|
|E_FAIL  <br/> |The call failed.  <br/> |
|E_INVALIDARG  <br/> |One or more parameters are invalid.  <br/> |
|E_LSC_CACHEMISMATCH  <br/> |A SuppliedID already has a cache associated with it, but has a different ProgId or FileSystemDirectoryHint than the ones provided.  <br/> |
|E_LSC_DIRECTORYHINTCONFLICT  <br/> |The FileSystemDirectoryHint (or a subfolder) already exists on a different cache.  <br/> |
|E_LAC_PROGIDCONFLICT  <br/> |The ProgID already exists on a different cache.  <br/> |
|S_OK  <br/> |The call succeeded.  <br/> |
   
#### ILSCLocalSyncClient::LocalFileChange
<a name="ILSCLocalSyncClient_LocalFileChange"> </a>

LocalFileChange is used to tell the CsiSyncClient COM object to attempt to upload the specified file. The method will prepare the file for upload, including reading the file's current contents. If an upload is already pending, the previous upload will be discarded and the new contents prepared for upload. If the file is open for editing in an application, this method will return S_OK without preparing the file for upload (the application should already do this step if there are changes).
  
This method will allow uploads if it was marked as uploads blocked previously (see [ILSCLocalSyncClient::RenameFile ](using-csisyncclient-to-control-the-office-document-cache-odc.md#ILSCLocalSyncClient_RenameFile)).
  
`HRESULT ILSCLocalSyncClient::LocalFileChange ([in] BSTR bstrFileSystemPath, [in] BSTR bstrWebPath, [in] BSTR bstrResourceID)`

##### Parameters

 _bstrFileSystemPath_
  
A string which identifies the file on the client. This value must be a non-empty local path with a maximum of 256 characters. This path must be in the directory tree specified by the FileSystemDirectoryHint when the call to [ILSCLocalSyncClient::Initialize ](using-csisyncclient-to-control-the-office-document-cache-odc.md#ILSCLocalSyncClient_Initialize) was made. 
  
 _bstrResourceID_
  
A string which identifies the ResourceID of the file. This value must be non-empty with a maximum of 128 characters. 
  
 _bstrWebPath_
  
A string which identifies the file on the server. This value must be non-empty, valid URL, but no longer than INTERNET_MAX_URL_LENGTH, as defined by http://support.microsoft.com/kb/208427.

#### ILSCLocalSyncClient::ResetCache
<a name="ILSCLocalSyncClient_ResetCache"> </a>

ResetCache will delete the cache associated with the SuppliedID that was provided on Initialize. This includes all of the file information, but will leave the files on both the client and the server. This method also leaves the object in a partially uninitialized state. The only valid calls after this are [ILSCLocalSyncClient::Initialize ](using-csisyncclient-to-control-the-office-document-cache-odc.md#ILSCLocalSyncClient_Initialize) or [ILSCLocalSyncClient::Uninitialize ](using-csisyncclient-to-control-the-office-document-cache-odc.md#ILSCLocalSyncClient_Uninitialize). This method MAY be called if Initialize fails and returns E_LSC_CACHEMISMATCH, and will delete the cache associated with the SuppliedID that was provided with the failing call.

#### ILSCLocalSyncClient::ServerFileChange
<a name="ILSCLocalSyncClient_ServerFileChange"> </a>

ServerFileChange tells the CsiSyncClient COM object to mark the specified file for download. If the file is open in an Office application for edit, this method will return S_OK without marking the file for download (the application should already do this step if there are changes).
  
This method will allow downloads if it was marked as downloads blocked previously (see RenameFile).

#### ILSCLocalSyncClient::SetClientNetworkSyncPermission
<a name="ILSCLocalSyncClient_ServerFileChange"> </a>

SetClientNetworkSyncPermission is used to either override or restoreOffice's synchronizing heuristics for network cost and power usage. When on a 3G or other high cost network, or when running on battery versus being plugged in, Office may choose to block network traffic until a more opportune time. The consumer of this API can use it to override Office's heuristics and force synchronizing to occur.

##### Parameters

 _eEventTypeOccurred_
  
The event type of this event. See [Enum LSCEventTypeOccurred](using-csisyncclient-to-control-the-office-document-cache-odc.md#Enum_LSCEventTypeOccurred) for valid values.

## Enumerations

CSISyncClient uses the following enumerations.
  
### Enum LSCEventSyncErrorType
<a name="Enum_LSCEventSyncErrorType"> </a>

This enumeration specifies the categories of errors that can occur while synchronizing a file.
  
|Enumerator|Description|
|:-----|:-----|
|LSCEventSyncErrorType_UserInterventionRequiredUnexpected  <br/> |The synchronizing error of this event was unexpected, and may require special consideration. By default, the user may have to intervene.  <br/> |
|LSCEventSyncErrorType_NoInterventionRequired  <br/> |The synchronizing error of this event does not need special consideration. Office will handle it automatically.  <br/> |
|LSCEventSyncErrorType_UserInterventionRequired  <br/> |The synchronizing error of this event requires a user to resolve it. For example, merge conflict error requires a user to open the document and merge it.  <br/> |
|LSCEventSyncErrorType_WaitingOnClient  <br/> |The synchronizing error of this event requires the consumer to intervene, but should not require special consideration by the user.  <br/> |
|LSCEventSyncErrorType_ClientInterventionRequired  <br/> |The synchronizing error of this event requires the consumer to intervene as a special case.  <br/> |
|LSCEventSyncErrorType_Max  <br/> ||
   
### Enum LSCEventType
<a name="Enum_LSCEventType"> </a>
