## Behavior changes in the Object Model
<a name="OEV_CompatIssues_Changed"> </a>

These messages can appear if the add-in or macro-enabled document code uses an object, member, collection, enumeration, or constant that behaves differently from previous versions of Office.
  
**Table 3. Issues displayed in the telemetry log about behavior changes**

|**Event ID**|**Introduced in version**|**Applications affected**|**Additional Information**|**Title**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|10156  <br/> |Office 2016  <br/> |Word  <br/> ||OM Behavior Change: Use of save events detected  <br/> |The compatibility checker has detected use of save events which may cause an undesirable experience during real-time co-authoring. Your solution may not work as intended during real time co-authoring sessions due to the higher save frequency during those scenarios. We recommend adjusting the solution to throttle during frequent saves. Alternatively, disable real time co-authoring by using Group Policy.  <br/> |
|10160  <br/> |Office 2016  <br/> |Word, Excel, PowerPoint  <br/> ||OM Behavior Change: Application.DisplayDocumentInformationPanel  <br/> |The Document Information Panel has been deprecated as part of InfoPath product deprecation. Querying this property will always return false. Setting this property varies by application. Setting it to true will show the Property Panel for Word and PowerPoint and do nothing in Excel. Setting it to false does nothing in all apps.  <br/> |
|10161  <br/> |Office 2016  <br/> |Word  <br/> ||OM Behavior Change: ContentControl.DropdownListEntries  <br/> |The Document Information Panel has been deprecated as part of InfoPath product deprecation. When acting against SharePoint lookup properties the behavior of this API is no longer supported. It works as expected with other types of list entries.  <br/> |
|10157  <br/> |Office 2016  <br/> |PowerPoint  <br/> ||OM Behavior Change: Presentation.InMergeMode Property  <br/> |The old merge mode that appears in the document window when co-authoring has been replaced with a new conflict resolution window. If accessed in this situation, the Presentation.InMergeMode property will return False.  <br/> |
|10106  <br/> |Office 2013  <br/> |Excel 2013  <br/> ||OM Behavior Change: Application.FormulaBarHeight Property  <br/> |The [Application.FormulaBarHeight Property (Excel)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ff377046-06cb-9cf7-32f5-773da447c184%28Office.15%29.aspx) property is changed. If accessed, the property reads and writes the height of the formula bar associated with the active window in Excel. To change formula bar height for another window in Excel, set the **Application.FormulaBarHeight** property after activating the window.  <br/> |
|10107  <br/> |Office 2013  <br/> |Excel 2013  <br/> ||OM Behavior Change: Workbook.Protect Method  <br/> |Window structure (height, width, minimized or maximized state) cannot be protected in Excel. If called, the [Workbook.Protect Method (Excel)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/0e270b93-7b0b-cc68-c7c0-4002024f4292%28Office.15%29.aspx) method does not protect the workbook window structure regardless of the value of the Windows parameter.  <br/> |
|10140  <br/> |Office 2013  <br/> |Word 2013, Outlook 2013  <br/> ||OM Behavior Change: Table.AllowPageBreaks  <br/> |The **Table.AllowPageBreaks** property is hidden, and always returns TRUE. To achieve the same behavior, use the [ParagraphFormat.KeepTogether Property (Word)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/7cc4cade-f986-8dad-a1b3-e1fade4c6825%28Office.15%29.aspx) and [ParagraphFormat.KeepWithNext Property (Word)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/5fc8ad97-d839-7837-04c7-dac2efe1d1c2%28Office.15%29.aspx) properties.  <br/> |

To use the new features of Office 2010 and above, replace the **Document.SaveAs** method with the [Document.SaveAs2 Method (Word)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa491007-0e31-26f5-3a5e-477381529b6e%28Office.15%29.aspx).  <br/> |
