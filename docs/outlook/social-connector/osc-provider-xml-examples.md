# OSC Provider XML Examples

This section contains XML examples that use the **capabilities**, **friends**, and **activityFeed** XML elements, complying with the Outlook Social Connector (OSC) provider XML schema. 
  
- [Capabilities XML Example](capabilities-xml-example.md) shows the **capabilities** XML of an OSC provider, specifying its capabilities and requirements for the OSC. 
    
- [Friends XML Example](friends-xml-example.md) shows the **friends** XML for two persons on the social network. 
    
- [Activity Feed XML Example](activity-feed-xml-example.md) shows the **activityFeed** XML of four activities: two profile picture updates, a status update, and a blog post. The XML also specifies three activity display templates for displaying the corresponding activities.
