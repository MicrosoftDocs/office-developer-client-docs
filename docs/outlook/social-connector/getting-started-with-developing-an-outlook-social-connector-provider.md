# Getting started with developing an Outlook Social Connector provider

The Outlook Social Connector (OSC) Provider Reference describes how to develop an OSC provider by using OSC provider extensibility. If you are new to developing solutions for Outlook, see [Selecting an API or Technology for Developing Outlook Solutions](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/8295da20-e567-4d08-b8e4-5c9b4498edd4%28Office.15%29.aspx) to identify the APIs and technologies that are most appropriate for your needs.
