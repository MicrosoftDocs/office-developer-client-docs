## Remarks

Success, warning, and error values are returned by using a 32-bit number that is called a result handle, or **HRESULT**. An **HRESULT** is not a handle to anything; it is merely a 32-bit value that has several fields encoded in the value. A positive result indicates success with status, a zero result indicates success without status (S_OK), and a negative result indicates failure.
