# ISocialSession2::GetPeopleDetails

Returns a string that contains a collection of person and picture details for the users specified by the  _personsAddresses_ parameter. 
  
```
HRESULT _stdcall GetPeopleDetails([in] BSTR personsAddresses, [out, retval] BSTR* personsCollection);
```

## Parameters

 _personsAddresses_
  
> [in] An XML string that specifies the hashed SMTP addresses of a set of users.
    
 _personsCollection_
  
> [out] An XML string that contains a collection of person and picture details.
    
## Remarks

The Outlook Social Connector (OSC) calls **GetPeopleDetails** if the OSC provider supports on-demand or hybrid synchronization of friends and non-friends. 
  
The  _personsAddresses_ parameter must conform to the schema definition for **hashedAddresses**, as defined in the schema for OSC provider extensibility. The  _personsAddresses_ string represents a set of hashed SMTP addresses for each user displayed in the People Pane. The user does not have to be a friend of the logged-on user represented by the [ISocialSession::LoggedOnUserName](isocialsession-loggedonusername.md) property. The hashed SMTP addresses are encrypted by using the hashing function specified by the **hashFunction** element in the provider's **capabilities** XML. The OSC identifies each **hashedAddress** in the  _personAddresses_ collection with an **index** element. The provider must use the **index** element to identify the recipient's **person** XML when it returns **friends** XML for **GetPeopleDetails**. If the recipient is not a registered user on the social network, the provider must not return any **person** XML for that recipient. The **index** element for each network user represented by **person** XML corresponds to the **index** element for the recipient in  _personsAddresses_.
  
The OSC stores the information returned by the  _personsCollection_ parameter in memory. The  _personsCollection_ XML string must conform to the schema definition for **friends**, as defined in the schema for OSC provider extensibility. For more information about how the OSC uses and updates this information in memory, see [Synchronizing Friends and Activities](synchronizing-friends-and-activities.md).
