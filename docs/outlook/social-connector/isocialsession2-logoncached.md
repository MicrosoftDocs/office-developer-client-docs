# ISocialSession2::LogonCached

Logs on to the social network site by using cached credentials.
  
```cpp
HRESULT _stdcall LogonCached([in] BSTR connectIn, [in] BSTR userName, [in] BSTR password,  [out] BSTR connectOut);
```

## Parameters

_connectIn_
  
> [in] A string that can be empty or contains the logon credentials, depending on the context in which the OSC is calling **LogonCached**.
    
_userName_
  
> [in] A string that contains the user name.
    
_password_
  
> [in] A string that contains the user's password.
    
_connectOut_
  
> [out] An opaque string that contains credentials.
    
## Remarks

This method is called for authentication only if **useLogonCached** is set as **true** in the **capabilities** XML returned by [ISocialProvider::GetCapabilities](isocialprovider-getcapabilities.md).
  
The Outlook Social Connector (OSC) calls **LogonCached**, and passes an empty string for  _connectIn_ and non-empty  _userName_ and  _password_ strings. The provider uses  _userName_ and  _password_ to log on to the social network, and returns an opaque  _connectOut_ parameter to the OSC if authentication succeeds. If authentication fails, the provider returns the OSC_E_LOGON_FAILURE error to the OSC. 
  
The  _connectOut_ parameter is an opaque string to the OSC, and is passed to the  _connectIn_ parameter on subsequent attempts by the OSC to log on to the social network. The provider should place any credentials in the  _connectOut_ string that the provider wants the OSC to store across connections. The OSC does not interpret the string in  _connectOut_, and encrypts the string for security purposes before storing it in the Windows registry.
