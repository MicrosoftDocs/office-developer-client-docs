# Appointments

This section provides sample tasks that involve appointments. Appointments include events, meetings, and recurring appointments, to name a few. Outlook uses the [AppointmentItem](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb645611\(v=office.15\)) object to represent appointments in the Calendar folder.
