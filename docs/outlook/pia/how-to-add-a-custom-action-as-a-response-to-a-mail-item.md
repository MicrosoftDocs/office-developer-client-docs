# Add a custom action as a response to a mail item

This example shows how to add custom actions as a response to an email item by using the [Add()](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb612077\(v=office.15\)) method of the [Actions](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb611963\(v=office.15\)) collection.

## Example

> [!NOTE] 
> The following code example is an excerpt from [Programming Applications for Microsoft Office Outlook 2007](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0735622493?ie=UTF8&tag=msmsdn-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0735622493).


You can create custom actions programmatically to appear on the ribbon in the **Actions** group on the **Message** tab in an email response. In the following code example, ReplyWithVoiceMail creates and adds a custom action named “Reply with Voice Mail” to the inspector command bar. ReplyWithVoiceMail first gets a [\_MailItem](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb610623\(v=office.15\)) object and then creates an [Action](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb646971\(v=office.15\)) object by calling the **Add** method of the **Actions** collection that is associated with the **MailItem**. It then sets the [Name](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb624053\(v=office.15\)) property of the **Action** object to “Reply with Voice Mail”. The [ReplyStyle](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb624278\(v=office.15\)), [ResponseStyle](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb622491\(v=office.15\)), [CopyLike](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb624213\(v=office.15\)), and [MessageClass](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb624391\(v=office.15\)) properties are also set. Finally, the **MailItem**is saved.


> [!NOTE]
> You can also add custom actions at design time by using the Outlook Forms Designer.


If you use Visual Studio to test this code example, you must first add a reference to the Microsoft Outlook 15.0 Object Library component and specify the Outlook variable when you import the **Microsoft.Office.Interop.Outlook** namespace. The **using** statement must not occur directly before the functions in the code example but must be added before the public Class declaration. The following line of code shows how to do the import and assignment in C\#.

```csharp
using Outlook = Microsoft.Office.Interop.Outlook;

    private void ReplyWithVoiceMail()
    {
        Outlook.MailItem mail = (Outlook.MailItem)Application.ActiveInspector().CurrentItem;
        Outlook.Action action = mail.Actions.Add();
        action.Name = “Reply with Voice Mail”;
        action.ReplyStyle = Outlook.OlActionReplyStyle.olUserPreference;
        action.ResponseStyle = Outlook.OlActionResponseStyle.olOpen;
        action.CopyLike = Outlook.OlActionCopyLike.olReply;
        action.MessageClass = “IPM.Post.Voice Message”;
        mail.Save();
    }
```
