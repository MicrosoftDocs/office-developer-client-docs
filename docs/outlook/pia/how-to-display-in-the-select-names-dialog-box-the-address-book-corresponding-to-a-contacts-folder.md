# Display in the Select Names dialog box the address book corresponding to a Contacts folder

This example shows how to obtain the address book that corresponds to the default Contacts folder, and then displays the address book in the **Select Names** dialog box.

## Example

All address books in Outlook are represented as a collection by the [AddressLists](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb624048\(v=office.15\)) property of the [NameSpace](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb645857\(v=office.15\)) object. The code sample uses the [GetContactsFolder](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb609225\(v=office.15\)) method of the [AddressList](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb623538\(v=office.15\)) object to find the contact folder that corresponds to each address list. Each Outlook folder has an Entry ID. Compare the Entry ID of the default Contacts folder with the Entry ID of a Contacts folder to produce the AddressList that corresponds to the default Contacts folder.

Before displaying the address list corresponding to the default Contacts folder in the **Select Names** dialog box, the code sample sets it as the value of the [InitialAddressList](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb646633\(v=office.15\)) property of the [SelectNamesDialog](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb609866\(v=office.15\)) object.

If you use Visual Studio to test this code example, you must first add a reference to the Microsoft Outlook 15.0 Object Library component and specify the Outlook variable when you import the **Microsoft.Office.Interop.Outlook** namespace. The **Imports** or **using** statement must not occur directly before the functions in the code example but must be added before the public Class declaration. The following lines of code show how to do the import and assignment in Visual Basic and C\#.

```vb
Imports Outlook = Microsoft.Office.Interop.Outlook
```


```csharp
using Outlook = Microsoft.Office.Interop.Outlook;
```


```vb
Private Sub ShowContactsFolderAsInitialAddressList()
    Dim addrLists As Outlook.AddressLists
    Dim contactsFolder As Outlook.Folder = _
        CType(Application.Session.GetDefaultFolder( _
        Outlook.OlDefaultFolders.olFolderContacts), _
        Outlook.Folder)
    addrLists = Application.Session.AddressLists
    For Each addrList As Outlook.AddressList In addrLists
        Dim testFolder As Outlook.Folder = _
        CType(addrList.GetContactsFolder(), Outlook.Folder)
        If Not (testFolder Is Nothing) Then
            ' Test to determine if Folder returned
            ' by GetContactsFolder has same EntryID
            ' as default Contacts folder.
            If (Application.Session.CompareEntryIDs( _
                contactsFolder.EntryID, testFolder.EntryID)) Then
                Dim snd As Outlook.SelectNamesDialog = _
                    Application.Session.GetSelectNamesDialog()
                snd.InitialAddressList = addrList
                snd.Display()
            End If
        End If
    Next
End Sub
```


```csharp
private void ShowContactsFolderAsInitialAddressList()
{
    Outlook.AddressLists addrLists;
    Outlook.Folder contactsFolder =
        Application.Session.GetDefaultFolder(
        Outlook.OlDefaultFolders.olFolderContacts)
        as Outlook.Folder;
    addrLists = Application.Session.AddressLists;
    foreach (Outlook.AddressList addrList in addrLists)
    {
        Outlook.Folder testFolder =
            addrList.GetContactsFolder() as Outlook.Folder;
        if (testFolder != null)
        {
            // Test to determine if Folder returned
            // by GetContactsFolder has same EntryID
            // as default Contacts folder.
            if (Application.Session.CompareEntryIDs(
                contactsFolder.EntryID, testFolder.EntryID))
            {
                Outlook.SelectNamesDialog snd =
                    Application.
                    Session.GetSelectNamesDialog();
                snd.InitialAddressList = addrList;
                snd.Display();
             }
         }
    }
}
```
