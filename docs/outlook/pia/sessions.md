# Sessions

This section includes a sample task that pertains to Microsoft Outlook sessions. A session is a period of time during which a user logs on to Outlook. A session is represented in Outlook by the [NameSpace](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb645857\(v=office.15\)) class. This class supports logging in and out, accessing storage objects directly by ID, accessing certain special default folders directly, and accessing data sources owned by other users. The only supported data source is MAPI, which allows access to all Outlook data stored in the user's mail stores.
