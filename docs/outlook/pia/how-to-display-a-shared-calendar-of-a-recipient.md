# Display a shared calendar of a recipient

This example shows how to display a recipient's shared calendar by using the [CreateRecipient(String)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb609962\(v=office.15\)) and [GetSharedDefaultFolder(Recipient, OlDefaultFolders)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb644850\(v=office.15\)) methods.

## Example

> [!NOTE] 
> The following code example is an excerpt from [Programming Applications for Microsoft Office Outlook 2007](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0735622493?ie=UTF8&tag=msmsdn-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0735622493).

Sendable items such as [MailItem](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb643865\(v=office.15\)) objects always expose the [Recipients](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb646686\(v=office.15\)) property which, in turn, enables you to access the [Recipients](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb646361\(v=office.15\)) collection for the sendable item. To create a [Recipient](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb624370\(v=office.15\)) object that is not bound to the **Recipients** collection of an item, use the [CreateRecipient(String)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb609962\(v=office.15\)) method of the [NameSpace](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb645857\(v=office.15\)) object. Then pass this unbound **Recipient** object to the [GetSharedDefaultFolder(Recipient, OlDefaultFolders)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb644850\(v=office.15\)) method, which returns a shared Exchange folder. You can then open the shared Exchange folder and display that folder in an explorer window. GetSharedDefaultFolder is used in Exchange delegate scenarios where the delegate has permission to access the folder of the delegator. Before you pass the **Recipient** object to the GetSharedDefaultFolder method, you must resolve it. To resolve a **Recipient** object, call its [Resolve()](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb624165\(v=office.15\)) method.

In the following code example, DisplayManagerCalendar opens and displays the Calendar folder of the current user’s manager by calling **CreateRecipient** and **GetSharedDefaultFolder**. An alert dialog box is displayed if the user does not have permission to open the manager’s Calendar folder or an error occurs.


> [!NOTE]
> When you create a **Recipient** object by using the **CreateRecipient** method of the **Namespace** object or the [Add(String)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb612668(v=office.15)) method of the **Recipients** collection, you must provide a recipient name. The **Recipient** is then resolved against this name. A recipient name can take any of the following formats:
> - Display name
> - Alias
> - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) address

If you use Visual Studio to test this code example, you must first add a reference to the Microsoft Outlook 15.0 Object Library component and specify the Outlook variable when you import the **Microsoft.Office.Interop.Outlook** namespace. The **using** statement must not occur directly before the functions in the code example but must be added before the public Class declaration. The following line of code shows how to do the import and assignment in C\#.

```csharp
using Outlook = Microsoft.Office.Interop.Outlook;
```

```csharp
private void DisplayManagerCalendar()
{
    Outlook.AddressEntry addrEntry =
        Application.Session.CurrentUser.AddressEntry;
    if (addrEntry.Type == "EX")
    {
        Outlook.ExchangeUser manager =
            Application.Session.CurrentUser.
            AddressEntry.GetExchangeUser().GetExchangeUserManager();
        if (manager != null)
        {
            Outlook.Recipient recip =
                Application.Session.CreateRecipient(manager.Name);
            if (recip.Resolve())
            {
                try
                {
                    Outlook.Folder folder =
                        Application.Session.GetSharedDefaultFolder(
                        recip, Outlook.OlDefaultFolders.olFolderCalendar)
                        as Outlook.Folder;
                    folder.Display();
                }
                catch
                {
                    MessageBox.Show("Could not open manager's calendar.",
                        "GetSharedDefaultFolder Example",
                        MessageBoxButtons.OK,
                        MessageBoxIcon.Error);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
