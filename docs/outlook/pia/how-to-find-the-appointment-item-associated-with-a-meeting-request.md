# Find the appointment item associated with a meeting request

This example shows how to use the [GetAssociatedAppointment(Boolean)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb652725\(v=office.15\)) method to find the appointment that is associated with a meeting request.

## Example

> [!NOTE] 
> The following code example is an excerpt from [Programming Applications for Microsoft Office Outlook 2007](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0735622493?ie=UTF8&tag=msmsdn-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0735622493).

A [MeetingItem](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb645703\(v=office.15\)) object does not represent an appointment, but a message that contains a request to add an appointment to the recipient’s calendar. In the following code example, MeetingRequestExample uses the [GetAssociatedAppointment(Boolean)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb652725\(v=office.15\)) method of the **MeetingItem** object on each **MeetingItem** retrieved from the user’s Inbox. The returned [AppointmentItem](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb645611\(v=office.15\)) object is then used to write the subject of the appointment to the trace listeners of the [Listeners](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.debug.listeners.aspx) collection.


> [!NOTE]
> Note that **GetAssociatedAppointment** argument is set to **false** so that the appointment is not added to the user’s calendar.

If you use Visual Studio to test this code example, you must first add a reference to the Microsoft Outlook 15.0 Object Library component and specify the Outlook variable when you import the **Microsoft.Office.Interop.Outlook** namespace. The **using** statement must not occur directly before the functions in the code example but must be added before the public Class declaration. The following line of code shows how to do the import and assignment in C\#.

```csharp
using Outlook = Microsoft.Office.Interop.Outlook;
```


```csharp
private void MeetingRequestsExample()
{
    Outlook.Folder folder = Application.Session.
        GetDefaultFolder(Outlook.OlDefaultFolders.olFolderInbox)
        as Outlook.Folder;
    string filter = "[MessageClass] = " +
        "'IPM.Schedule.Meeting.Request'";
    Outlook.Items items = folder.Items.Restrict(filter);
    foreach (Outlook.MeetingItem request in items)
    {
        Outlook.AppointmentItem appt =
            request.GetAssociatedAppointment(false);
        if (appt != null)
        {
            Debug.WriteLine(appt.Subject);
        }
    }
}
```
