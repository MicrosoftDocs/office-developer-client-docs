# Get information about direct reports of the current user's manager

This example gets the direct reports of the current user’s manager, if any, and then displays information about each of the manager’s direct reports.

## Example

> [!NOTE] 
> The following code example is an excerpt from [Programming Applications for Microsoft Office Outlook 2007](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0735622493?ie=UTF8&tag=msmsdn-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0735622493).

In the following example, the GetManagerDirectReports procedure calls the [GetExchangeUserManager()](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb646656\(v=office.15\)) method to get the user’s manager, represented by an [ExchangeUser](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb609574\(v=office.15\)) object. If the current user has a manager, [GetDirectReports()](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb647204\(v=office.15\)) is called to return an [AddressEntries](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb647650\(v=office.15\)) collection that represents the address entries for all the direct reports of user’s manager. If the manager has no direct reports, **GetDirectReports** returns an **AddressEntries** collection that has a count of zero. Once the manager’s direct reports are obtained, GetManagerDirectReports writes information about each of the manager’s direct reports to the trace listeners of the [Listeners](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.debug.listeners.aspx) collection.


> [!NOTE]
> The signed-in user must be online for this method to return an **AddressEntries** collection; otherwise, **GetDirectReports** returns a null reference. For production code, you must test for the user being offline by using the [\_NameSpace.ExchangeConnectionMode](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb647638(v=office.15)) property, or the [\_Account.ExchangeConnectionMode](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff185249(v=office.15)) property for multiple Exchange scenarios.

If you use Visual Studio to test this code example, you must first add a reference to the Microsoft Outlook 15.0 Object Library component and specify the Outlook variable when you import the **Microsoft.Office.Interop.Outlook** namespace. The **using** statement must not occur directly before the functions in the code example but must be added before the public Class declaration. The following line of code shows how to do the import and assignment in C\#.

```csharp
using Outlook = Microsoft.Office.Interop.Outlook;
```


```csharp
private void GetManagerDirectReports()
{
    Outlook.AddressEntry currentUser =
        Application.Session.CurrentUser.AddressEntry;
    if (currentUser.Type == "EX")
    {
        Outlook.ExchangeUser manager =
            currentUser.GetExchangeUser().GetExchangeUserManager();
        if (manager != null)
        {
            Outlook.AddressEntries addrEntries =
                manager.GetDirectReports();
            if (addrEntries != null)
            {
                foreach (Outlook.AddressEntry addrEntry
                    in addrEntries)
                {
                    Outlook.ExchangeUser exchUser =
                        addrEntry.GetExchangeUser();
                    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
                    sb.AppendLine("Name: "
                        + exchUser.Name);
                    sb.AppendLine("Title: "
                        + exchUser.JobTitle);
                    sb.AppendLine("Department: "
                        + exchUser.Department);
                    sb.AppendLine("Location: "
                        + exchUser.OfficeLocation);
                    Debug.WriteLine(sb.ToString());
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
