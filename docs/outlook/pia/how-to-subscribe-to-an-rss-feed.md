# Subscribe to an RSS feed

This example shows how to subscribe to an RSS feed by using the [OpenSharedFolder(String, Object, Object, Object)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb610157\(v=office.15\)) method.

## Example

> [!NOTE] 
> The following code example is an excerpt from [Programming Applications for Microsoft Office Outlook 2007](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0735622493?ie=UTF8&tag=msmsdn-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0735622493).

The Outlook object model supports providing access to shared data, such as Internet calendars, RSS feeds, and data from Microsoft SharePoint lists and document libraries. It enables connecting to these shared sources of data and setting up the synchronization contexts to continue to poll those shared resources. The Outlook object model provides the [OpenSharedFolder(String, Object, Object, Object)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb610157\(v=office.15\)) method of the [NameSpace](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb645857\(v=office.15\)) object to download and synchronize with a particular type of shared folder.

In the following example, AddRssFeed subscribes to a new RSS feed named “Example RSS Feed” by calling the **OpenSharedFolder** method with a URL that refers to the new RSS feed. The last two parameters of **OpenSharedFolder** method are set to **true** to indicate that attachments should be downloaded, and Outlook should use the refresh ratio provided in the RSS feed.


> [!NOTE]
> You must specify the correct protocol handler for the folder URL in the **OpenSharedFolder** method to subscribe to an RSS feed. For example, you must use a URL that begins with `feed://` instead of `http://`. Outlook cannot open RSS feeds that require authentication unless Windows NT LAN Manager (NTLM) authentication is available, and it cannot load RSS feeds from Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) locations.

If you use Visual Studio to test this code example, you must first add a reference to the Microsoft Outlook 15.0 Object Library component and specify the Outlook variable when you import the **Microsoft.Office.Interop.Outlook** namespace. The **using** statement must not occur directly before the functions in the code example but must be added before the public Class declaration. The following line of code shows how to do the import and assignment in C\#.

```csharp
using Outlook = Microsoft.Office.Interop.Outlook;
```


```csharp
private void AddRssFeed()
{
    string feedUrl = "feed://example.org/rssfeed.xml";
    Outlook.Folder subscriptionFolder =
        Application.Session.OpenSharedFolder(feedUrl, "Example RSS Feed", true, true) as Outlook.Folder;
    Outlook.Explorer exp =
        Application.Explorers.Add(subscriptionFolder, Outlook.OlFolderDisplayMode.olFolderDisplayNormal);
    exp.Display();
}
```
