# Best practices in developing managed Outlook add-ins

Even though the Outlook interop assemblies allow you to write managed solutions that interoperate with Outlook, Outlook predates the .NET Framework and is designed to support programmability through unmanaged languages such as Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) and Visual Basic. This topic lists the top areas that you should be aware of when you develop a managed add-in for Outlook.
