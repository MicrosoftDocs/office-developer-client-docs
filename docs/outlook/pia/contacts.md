# Contacts

This section provides sample topics that involve contacts. Contacts represent people and businesses you want to communicate with. The Contacts folder is your e-mail address book and information storage for the contacts. A [ContactItem](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb644956\(v=office.15\)) object is an Outlook built-in object that represents unique contacts in a Contacts folder. The ContactItem object has over 100 properties, such as [FirstName](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb652965\(v=office.15\)), [CompanyName](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb610212\(v=office.15\)), and [OfficeLocation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb647145\(v=office.15\)), as well as custom properties if the built-in properties are not sufficient, that you can use to store information about each contact.
