# How Do I... (Outlook 2013 PIA Reference)

This section contains procedural tasks topics and code examples in Visual Basic and C\# that demonstrate how to perform some common tasks in Outlook.

To run these code examples, you must have installed Outlook 2010 and Visual Studio 2008, or a later version of these products.

The code examples in this section do not require that you have installed Office Developer Tools for Visual Studio. However, you can refer to the [Office Development with Visual Studio](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vsto/default.aspx) portal on MSDN for information about using the tools, and refer to [Outlook Solutions](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb386094\(v=office.15\)) for some basic how-to tasks written in managed code.

Code examples in this section range from the beginner to the intermediate levels, and some of them are adapted from the book [Programming Applications for Microsoft Office Outlook 2007](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0735622493?ie=utf8%26tag=msmsdn-20%26linkcode=as2%26camp=1789%26creative=9325%26creativeasin=0735622493).

The Office Developer Documentation team welcomes your task ideas and code samples. If we use your code samples in Outlook content, we will recognize your work with a byline and a link to your Web site. For more information, contact us at docthis@microsoft.com.
