# General Outlook Items

Further examples are available under sections specific for the [\_AppointmentItem](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb623692\(v=office.15\)), [\_ContactItem](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb643903\(v=office.15\)), and [\_MailItem](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb610623\(v=office.15\)) objects.

## In this section

  - [Create a Helper Class to Access Common Outlook Item Members](how-to-create-a-helper-class-to-access-common-outlook-item-members.md)

Several other how-to topics listed in the See Also section below take advantage of this helper class.

  - [Display Selected Items in the Active Explorer](how-to-display-selected-items-in-the-active-explorer.md)
