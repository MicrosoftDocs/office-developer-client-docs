# IMAPIMessageSite::SubmitMessage

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
Requests that the current message be queued for delivery.
  
```cpp
HRESULT SubmitMessage(
  ULONG ulFlags
);
```

## Parameters

 _ulFlags_
  
> [in] A bitmask of flags that controls how a message is submitted. The following flag can be set:
    
FORCE_SUBMIT 
  
> MAPI should submit the message even if it might not be sent immediately.
    
## Return value

S_OK 
  
> The call succeeded and has returned the expected value or values.
    
## Remarks

Form objects call the **IMAPIMessageSite::SubmitMessage** method to request that a message be queued for delivery. The message site should call the [IPersistMessage::HandsOffMessage](ipersistmessage-handsoffmessage.md) method before submitting the message. The message does not need to have been previously saved, because **SubmitMessage** should cause the message to be saved if the message has been modified. After the return of **SubmitMessage**, the form must check for a current message and then dismiss itself if none exists. 
  
For a list of interfaces related to form servers, see [MAPI Form Interfaces](mapi-form-interfaces.md).
