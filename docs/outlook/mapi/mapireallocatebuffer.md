```cpp
STDMETHODIMP_(SCODE) MAPIReallocateBuffer
(
LPVOID lpv, 
ULONG ulSize, 
LPVOID * lppv
);
```

## Parameters

 _lpv_
  
> A pointer to the memory to be reallocated.
    
 _ulSize_
  
> The size, in bytes, of the buffer to be allocated.
    
 _lppv_
  
> A pointer to the returned allocated buffer.
    
## Remarks

 **MAPIReallocateBuffer** allocates a new block of memory of the requested size and copies the contents of the buffer that is passed into this new block of memory. If the block of memory that is passed contains internal pointers, the pointers do not change to match the new location.
