# Adding Rendering Information to Formatted Text

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
To indicate the location in formatted text where an attachment is rendered, you must insert a sequence of placeholder characters in the message's **PR_RTF_COMPRESSED** ([PidTagRtfCompressed](pidtagrtfcompressed-canonical-property.md)) property. The placeholder sequence is made up of the following characters:  `\objattph`.
  
 **To add rendering information to formatted message text**
  
- When writing the stream of text to the message's **PR_RTF_COMPRESSED** property, insert the placeholder sequence and a space character at the position where the attachment should be rendered. 
    
- Set the **PR_RENDERING_POSITION** ([PidTagRenderingPosition](pidtagrenderingposition-canonical-property.md)) property of each attachment to a numeric value. The lowest value should be assigned to the **PR_RENDERING_POSITION** property of the first attachment to appear in the formatted text; the highest value to the last attachment.
