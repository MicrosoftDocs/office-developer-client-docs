|||
|:-----|:-----|
|Associated properties:  <br/> |PR_ORIGINAL_AUTHOR_ENTRYID  <br/> |
|Identifier:  <br/> |0x004C  <br/> |
|Data type:  <br/> |PT_BINARY  <br/> |
|Area:  <br/> |General messaging  <br/> |
   
## Remarks

This property is one of the address properties for the author of a message. At first submission of the message, the client application should set this property to the value of **PR_SENDER_ENTRYID** ([PidTagSenderEntryId](pidtagsenderentryid-canonical-property.md)). It is never changed when the message is forwarded or replied to. 
  
The original author property allows for preservation of information from outside the local messaging domain. When a message arrives from another messaging domain, such as from the Internet, this property provides a way to ensure that original information is not lost.
