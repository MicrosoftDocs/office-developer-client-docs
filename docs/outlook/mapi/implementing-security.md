# Implementing Security

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
If the messaging system requires it, the transport provider is responsible for implementing an appropriate level of security for access to the messaging system. Each incoming or outgoing message sent through a transport provider by the MAPI spooler is handled in the context of a provider logon session. The transport provider can display a logon dialog box to the user that prompts for a user's credentials before establishing such a connection. Alternatively, the transport provider can store the user's previously entered credentials in the secure property range within a profile section and use them for access without prompting.
  
When implementing your transport provider's security, consider the following:
  
- With multiple installed service providers, there can be a multitude of names and passwords associated with a user.
    
- MAPI allows multiple sessions with multiple identities. Providers are encouraged to support multiple sessions but are not required to do so.
    
- Each session with a transport provider is associated by MAPI with a discrete section in the user's profile. The transport provider can use the [IMAPISupport::OpenProfileSection](imapisupport-openprofilesection.md) method to gain access to this section, which can be used to store any information associated with this session, including credentials. 
    
- With multiple installed transport providers, it is not necessarily true that the user only has a single email address. A user can have a separate email address for each installed transport provider or can have a different address for each session on a single provider.
    
For more information about storing credentials in profile sections, see [Message Services and Profiles](message-services-and-profiles.md) and [IProfSect : IMAPIProp](iprofsectimapiprop.md).
