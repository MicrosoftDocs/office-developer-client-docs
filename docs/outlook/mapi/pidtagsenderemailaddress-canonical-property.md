# PidTagSenderEmailAddress Canonical Property

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
Contains the message sender's e-mail address.
  
|||
|:-----|:-----|
|Associated properties:  <br/> |PR_SENDER_EMAIL_ADDRESS, PR_SENDER_EMAIL_ADDRESS_A, PR_SENDER_EMAIL_ADDRESS_W  <br/> |
|Identifier:  <br/> |0x0C1F  <br/> |
|Data type:  <br/> |PT_UNICOIDE, PT_STRING8  <br/> |
|Area:  <br/> |Address  <br/> |
   
## Remarks

These properties are examples of the address properties for the message sender. They must be set by the outgoing transport provider, which should never propagate any previously existing values.
  
If no transport provider has supplied any sender address properties, the MAPI spooler attempts to fill them in by calling the [IMAPISession::QueryIdentity](imapisession-queryidentity.md) method for an entry identifier. If no entry identifiers have been provided, the MAPI spooler stores "Unknown" in all the sender address properties of type PT_TSTRING.
