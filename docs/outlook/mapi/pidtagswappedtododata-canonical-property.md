## Remarks

Acting as the secondary flag storage location if sender flags or sender reminders are supported, this structure provides a location in which to store all of the properties relating to the Informational Flagging Protocol that are supported in sender flags, and all properties relating to the Reminder Settings Protocol that are supported in sender reminders without exposing the sender flag or sender reminder information to the recipients of a message.
  
Similarly, this structure provides a location in which to store all of the properties relating to the Informational Flagging Protocol that are supported in recipient flags and properties relating to the Reminder Settings Protocol that are supported in recipient reminders on a previously sent message.
