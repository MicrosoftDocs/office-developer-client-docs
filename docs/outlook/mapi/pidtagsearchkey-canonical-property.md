# PidTagSearchKey Canonical Property

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
Contains a binary-comparable key that identifies correlated objects for a search.

## Remarks

This property provides a trace for related objects, such as message copies, and facilitates finding unwanted occurrences, such as duplicate recipients.
  
MAPI uses specific rules for constructing search keys for message recipients. The search key is formed by concatenating the address type (in uppercase characters), the colon character ':', the email address in canonical form, and the terminating null character. Canonical form here means that case-sensitive addresses appear in the correct case, and addresses that are not case-sensitive are converted to uppercase. This is important in preserving correlations among messages.
  
For message objects, this property is available through the [IMAPIProp::GetProps](imapiprop-getprops.md) method immediately following message creation. For other objects, it is available following the first call to the [IMAPIProp::SaveChanges](imapiprop-savechanges.md) method. Because this property is changeable, it is unreliable to obtain it through **GetProps** until a **SaveChanges** call has committed any values set or changed by the [IMAPIProp::SetProps](imapiprop-setprops.md) method. 
  
For profiles, MAPI also furnishes a hard-coded profile section named **MUID_PROFILE_INSTANCE**, with this property as its single property. This key is guaranteed to be unique among all profiles ever created, and can be more reliable than the **PR_PROFILE_NAME** ([PidTagProfileName](pidtagprofilename-canonical-property.md)) property, which can be, for example, deleted and recreated with the same name.
  
The following table summarizes important differences among the **PR_ENTRYID** ([PidTagEntryId](pidtagentryid-canonical-property.md)), **PR_RECORD_KEY** ([PidTagRecordKey](pidtagrecordkey-canonical-property.md)), and this property.
