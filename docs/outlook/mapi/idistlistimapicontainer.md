# IDistList : IMAPIContainer

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
Provides access to distribution lists in modifiable address book containers. **IDistList** can create, copy, and delete distribution lists, in addition to performing name resolution.

## Remarks

The **IDistList** interface inherits from [IMAPIContainer](imapicontainerimapiprop.md) and includes the same methods as address book containers. Therefore, because the methods of the **IDistList** interface are identical to those of the [IABContainer](iabcontainerimapicontainer.md) interface, they are not duplicated here. 
  
A distribution list or object that implements **IDistList** is a collection of messaging user objects, or individual recipients. A distribution list can consist of all messaging user objects, or some messaging user and some distribution lists. 
  
There are typically two types of distribution lists:
  
- Distribution lists that are expanded by the underlying messaging system. This type of list has an address, **PR_EMAIL_ADDRESS** ( [PidTagEmailAddress](pidtagemailaddress-canonical-property.md)), and is treated the same as if it were an individual recipient. 
    
- Distribution lists that exist in a local container and are expanded by the client application.
    
Optional distribution list properties include the following:
  
- **PR_LAST_MODIFICATION_TIME** ( [PidTagLastModificationTime](pidtaglastmodificationtime-canonical-property.md))
    
- **PR_DISPLAY_TYPE** ( [PidTagDisplayType](pidtagdisplaytype-canonical-property.md)) 
    
- **PR_DETAILS_TABLE** ( [PidTagDetailsTable](pidtagdetailstable-canonical-property.md)) 
    
Notice that **PR_ADDRTYPE** is required, but **PR_EMAIL_ADDRESS** ( [PidTagEmailAddress](pidtagemailaddress-canonical-property.md)) is not. That is because a distribution list without an e-mail address can still receive messages, but its member list must be expanded. If the **PR_ADDRTYPE** property is set to MAPIPDL, MAPI performs the expansion. If **PR_ADDRTYPE** is a value other than MAPIPDL, the transport provider performs the expansion. 
  
For additional information about how to use the **IDistList** methods, see the reference entries for the parallel methods of **IABContainer**.
