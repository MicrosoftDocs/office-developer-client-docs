**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
Contains a subject prefix that typically indicates some action on a message, such as "FW: " for forwarding.

## Remarks

These properties are recommended on all message objects. 
  
The subject prefix consists of one or more alphanumeric characters, followed by a colon and a space (which are part of the prefix). It must not contain any nonalphanumeric characters before the colon. Absence of a prefix can be represented by an empty string or by this property not being set. 
  
If these properties are set explicitly, the string can be of any length and use any alphanumeric characters, but it must match a substring at the beginning of the **PR_SUBJECT** ([PidTagSubject](pidtagsubject-canonical-property.md)) property. If these properties are not set by the sender and must be computed, their contents are more restricted. The rule for computing the prefix is that **PR_SUBJECT** must begin with one, two, or three letters (alphabetic only) followed by a colon and a space. If such a substring is found at the beginning of **PR_SUBJECT**, it then becomes the string for these properties (and also stays at the beginning of **PR_SUBJECT**). Otherwise, these properties remain unset. 
  
These properties and **PR_NORMALIZED_SUBJECT** ([PidTagNormalizedSubject](pidtagnormalizedsubject-canonical-property.md)) should be computed as part of the [IMAPIProp::SaveChanges](imapiprop-savechanges.md) implementation. A client should not prompt [IMAPIProp::GetProps](imapiprop-getprops.md) for their values until they have been committed by an **IMAPIProp::SaveChanges** call. 
  
The subject properties are typically small strings of fewer than 256 characters, and a message store provider is not obligated to support the OLE **IStream** interface on them. A client should always attempt access through the **IMAPIProp** interface first, and resort to **IStream** only if **MAPI_E_NOT_ENOUGH_MEMORY** is returned.
