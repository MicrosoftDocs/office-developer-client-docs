# Operating Environment Issues

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 2013 | Outlook 2016 
  
The issues of operating system and operating environment are important when MAPI developers choose a development environment and an environment for Windows SDK installation.
  
MAPI developers must be aware that these choices affect the operating system that their component will run on and the range of components that they will be able to target.
