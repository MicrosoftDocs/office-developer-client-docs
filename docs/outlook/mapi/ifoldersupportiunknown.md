# IFolderSupport : IUnknown

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
Provides information about a folder's support for sharing.
  
|||
|:-----|:-----|
|Provided by:  <br/> |Message store provider  <br/> |
|Interface identifier:  <br/> |IID_IFolderSupport  <br/> |
   
## Vtable Order

|||
|:-----|:-----|
|**[GetSupportMask](ifoldersupport-getsupportmask.md)** <br/> |Gets information about a folder's support for sharing.  <br/> |
   
## Remarks

Generally, Microsoft Office Outlook requires a MAPI store provider to implement this interface if the provider wants to share a folder. The exception is the Exchange Server store provider, which can share folders without implementing this interface.
  
A client can query an **[IMAPIFolder](imapifolderimapicontainer.md)** for **IFolderSupport**. If that succeeds, call **IFolderSupport::GetSupportMask** and check for the **FS_SUPPORTS_SHARING** bit to be set.
