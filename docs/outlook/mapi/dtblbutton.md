```

## Members

 **ulbLpszLabel**
  
> Position in memory of the character string that is displayed on the button.
    
 **ulFlags**
  
> Bitmask of flags used to designate the format of the label pointed to by the **ulbLpszLabel** member. The following flag can be set: 
    
MAPI_UNICODE 
  
> The label is in Unicode format. If the MAPI_UNICODE flag is not set, the label is in ANSI format.
    
 **ulPRControl**
  
> Property tag for a property of type PT_OBJECT that implements the [IMAPIControl](imapicontroliunknown.md) interface. When the button is clicked, MAPI calls the [IMAPIProp::OpenProperty](imapiprop-openproperty.md) method for the display table's [IMAPIProp](imapipropiunknown.md) implementation to retrieve this property. 
    
## Remarks

A **DTBLBUTTON** structure describes a button a control that, when clicked, allows a user to begin an operation. Typically, clicking a button causes a modal dialog box to be displayed or a programmatic task to be invoked. Service providers can implement anything through a button control. If the button is supposed to perform a task based on the values of other controls, those controls must have set the DT_SET_IMMEDIATE flag. 
  
The **ulbLpszLabel** member is the position in memory of the character string that is displayed on the button. Service providers can add an ampersand character (&amp;) to indicate a Windows accelerator in the button label. Pressing an accelerator key has the same effect as clicking the button. 
  
The **ulPRControl** member describes an object property that, when opened with the **IMAPIProp::OpenProperty** method, returns a pointer to a control object. Implementing a control object that supports the **IMAPIControl** interface is a way to extend the MAPI feature set and define the operation or task that occurs when the button is clicked. **IMAPIControl** supplies two methods for manipulating buttons: [GetState](imapicontrol-getstate.md) to disable or enable buttons and [Activate](imapicontrol-activate.md) to handle button clicks.
