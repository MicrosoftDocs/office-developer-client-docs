# Implementing a Provider One-Off Table

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
MAPI calls your provider's [IABLogon::GetOneOffTable](iablogon-getoneofftable.md) method when the user of a client application adds a recipient to an outgoing message. Typically, the types of addresses requested are unique to your messaging system. If your provider supports recipient creation, it must supply a one-off table that exposes templates for every type of supported recipient address. If your provider does not support recipient creation, return MAPI_E_NO_SUPPORT from the **GetOneOffTable** call. 
  
MAPI will typically keep your provider's one-off table open for the lifetime of the session, releasing it only when a client calls either the subsystem's or address book's [IMAPIStatus::ValidateState](imapistatus-validatestate.md) method. MAPI registers for notifications on this table so that if templates are added or deleted, these changes can be reflected to the user. 
  
 **To implement IABLogon::GetOneOffTable**
  
1. Check the value of the flags parameter,  _ulFlags_. If the MAPI_UNICODE flag is set and your provider does not support Unicode, fail and return MAPI_E_BAD_CHARWIDTH. 
    
2. Check if your provider's one-off table has already been created. Because one-off tables are typically static, your provider never has to go through the creation process more than once. If a table already exists, return a pointer to it. 
    
3. If a one-off table does not yet exist, call **CreateTable** to create one. 
    
4. Set the following properties for the columns in your table rows:
    
  - **PR_DISPLAY_NAME** ([PidTagDisplayName](pidtagdisplayname-canonical-property.md)) to the name of the type of recipient that the template can create. 
    
  - **PR_ENTRYID** ([PidTagEntryId](pidtagentryid-canonical-property.md)) to the entry identifier for the one-off template.
    
  - **PR_DEPTH** ([PidTagDepth](pidtagdepth-canonical-property.md)) to indicate the hierarchy level in the one-off table display.
    
  - **PR_SELECTABLE** ([PidTagSelectable](pidtagselectable-canonical-property.md)) to TRUE to indicate if the row represents a template and FALSE otherwise.
    
  - **PR_ADDRTYPE** ([PidTagAddressType](pidtagaddresstype-canonical-property.md)) to the type of address created by the template.
    
  - **PR_DISPLAY_TYPE** ([PidTagDisplayType](pidtagdisplaytype-canonical-property.md)) to DT_MAILUSER or another value that indicates the type of display for the template.
    
  - **PR_INSTANCE_KEY** ([PidTagInstanceKey](pidtaginstancekey-canonical-property.md)) to a unique binary value. 
    
5. Call [ITableData::HrModifyRow](itabledata-hrmodifyrow.md) to modify the table directly. 
    
6. Call [ITableData::HrGetView](itabledata-hrgetview.md) to create an **IMAPITable** interface implementation to return to the caller.
