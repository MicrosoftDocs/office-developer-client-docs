# IMAPIFormFactory::LockServer

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
Keeps an open form server in memory.
  
```
HRESULT LockServer(
  ULONG ulFlags,
  ULONG fLockServer
);
```

## Parameters

 _ulFlags_
  
> [in] Reserved; must be zero.
    
 _fLockServer_
  
> [in] **true** to increment the lock count; otherwise, **false**.
    
## Return value

S_OK 
  
> The call succeeded and has returned the expected value or values.
    
## Remarks

Form viewers call the **IMAPIFormFactory::LockServer** method to keep an open form server application in memory. Keeping the form server in memory improves its performance when forms are frequently created and released. 
  
## Notes to Implementers

The **IMAPIFormFactory::LockServer** method is very similar to the [IClassFactory::LockServer](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms682332%28v=VS.85%29.aspx) method. Essentially, the **IMAPIFormFactory::LockServer** method maintains a count of how many times it has been called; as long as that count is greater than 0, the method prevents the form server from being unloaded from memory. You can use the [CoLockObjectExternal](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms680592%28VS.85%29.aspx) function to implement this.
