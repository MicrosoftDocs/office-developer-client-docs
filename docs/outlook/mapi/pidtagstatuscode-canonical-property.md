# PidTagStatusCode Canonical Property

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
Contains a bitmask of flags that indicate the current status of a session resource. All service providers set status codes as does MAPI to report on the status of the subsystem, the MAPI spooler, and the integrated address book.

## Remarks

The status code must appear in the Mapisvc.inf file for all providers. 
  
Status objects are implemented by MAPI and by all service providers. There are two sets of valid values for status codes, one set for all status objects and another set for transport providers only. All status objects can set this property to the following values:
  
STATUS_AVAILABLE 
  
> Indicates that the resource is operational.
    
STATUS_FAILURE 
  
> Indicates that the resource is experiencing a problem. For service providers, STATUS_FAILURE indicates that the provider might soon be shut down to end the current session.
    
STATUS_OFFLINE 
  
> Indicates that only local data or services are available.
    
Transport providers can also set their status objects' **PR_STATUS_CODE** properties to the following values: 
  
STATUS_INBOUND_ACTIVE 
  
> Indicates that the transport provider is receiving an inbound message. 
    
STATUS_INBOUND_ENABLED 
  
> Indicates that the transport provider can receive inbound messages.
    
STATUS_INBOUND_FLUSH 
  
> Indicates that the transport provider is downloading messages from the inbound queue.
    
STATUS_OUTBOUND_ACTIVE 
  
> Indicates that the transport provider is receiving an outbound message. 
    
STATUS_OUTBOUND_ENABLED 
  
> Indicates that the transport provider can handle outbound messages.
    
STATUS_OUTBOUND_FLUSH 
  
> Indicates that the transport provider is uploading messages from its outbound queue.
    
STATUS_REMOTE_ACCESS 
  
> Indicates that the transport provider supports remote access.
