|||
|:-----|:-----|
|Associated properties:  <br/> |PR_RESOURCE_METHODS  <br/> |
|Identifier:  <br/> |0x3E02  <br/> |
|Data type:  <br/> |PT_LONG  <br/> |
|Area:  <br/> |MAPI status  <br/> |
   
## Remarks

This property indicates which of the methods in a status object's implementation of **IMAPIStatus** are supported. Status objects are allowed to return MAPI_E_NO_SUPPORT from unsupported methods. 
  
Clients use a status object's **PR_RESOURCE_METHODS** property to avoid making calls to unsupported methods. If the flag that corresponds to a particular method is set, the method exists and can be called. If that flag is clear, the method should not be called. 
  
The status objects implemented by MAPI support the following methods:
  
|**Status object**|**Supported methods**|
|:-----|:-----|
|MAPI subsystem  <br/> |**ValidateState** only  <br/> |
|MAPI address book  <br/> |**ValidateState** only  <br/> |
|MAPI spooler  <br/> |**ValidateState** and **FlushQueues** <br/> |
   
One or more of the following flags can be set in **PR_RESOURCE_METHODS**:
  
STATUS_CHANGE_PASSWORD 
  
> Indicates that the [IMAPIStatus::ChangePassword](imapistatus-changepassword.md) method is supported. 
    
STATUS_FLUSH_QUEUES 
  
> Indicates that the [IMAPIStatus::FlushQueues](imapistatus-flushqueues.md) method is supported. 
    
STATUS_SETTINGS_DIALOG 
  
> Indicates that the [IMAPIStatus::SettingsDialog](imapistatus-settingsdialog.md) method is supported. 
    
STATUS_VALIDATE_STATE 
  
> Indicates that the [IMAPIStatus::ValidateState](imapistatus-validatestate.md) method is supported.
