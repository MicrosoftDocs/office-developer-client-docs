|:-----|:-----|
|Associated properties:  <br/> |PR_DEFAULT_VIEW_ENTRYID  <br/> |
|Identifier:  <br/> |0x3616  <br/> |
|Data type:  <br/> |PT_BINARY  <br/> |
|Area:  <br/> |MAPI container  <br/> |
   
## Remarks

This property is the entry identifier of the folder view that should be set as the initial view. The property need not be set if the "Normal" view is to be used as the initial view.
  
A client application can obtain this property at the time it opens the folder and realize significant performance gains. This property can be used as a shortcut to obtain the default view, instead of opening the associated contents table and submitting a restriction.
  
A service provider implementation of the [IMAPIFolder::CopyFolder](imapifolder-copyfolder.md) method can copy this property when it copies folders.
