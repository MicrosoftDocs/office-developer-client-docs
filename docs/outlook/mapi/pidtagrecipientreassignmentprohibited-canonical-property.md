## Remarks

This property is set based on the email message's **PR_SENSITIVITY** ([PidTagSensitivity](pidtagsensitivity-canonical-property.md)) value. If **PR_SENSITIVITY** is set to "0x00000000" (normal) or "0x00000003" (confidential), this property must be set to "0x00" or absent meaning that adding additional or different recipients to the email message is allowed. If the email object's **PR_SENSITIVITY** is set to "0x00000001" (personal) or "0x00000002" (private), this property must be set "0x01" to prevent adding additional or different recipients of this email through forwarding.
