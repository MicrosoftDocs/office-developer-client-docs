);
```

## Parameters

 _ulUIParam_

## Remarks

The MAPI spooler calls the **IXPLogon::FlushQueues** method to advise the transport provider that the MAPI spooler is about to begin processing messages. The transport provider should call the [IMAPISupport::ModifyStatusRow](imapisupport-modifystatusrow.md) method to set an appropriate bit for its state in the **PR_STATUS_CODE** ( [PidTagStatusCode](pidtagstatuscode-canonical-property.md)) property of its status row. After updating its status row, the transport provider should return S_OK for the **FlushQueues** call. The MAPI spooler then starts sending messages, with the operation being synchronous to the MAPI spooler. 
  
To support its implementation of the [IMAPIStatus::FlushQueues](imapistatus-flushqueues.md) method, the MAPI spooler calls **IXPLogon::FlushQueues** for all logon objects for active transport providers that are running in a profile session. When a transport provider's **FlushQueues** method is called as a result of a client application call to **IMAPIStatus::FlushQueues**, the message processing occurs asynchronously to the client.
