# PidLidAppointmentTimeZoneDefinitionStartDisplay Canonical Property

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
Contains a stream that maps to the persisted format of a [TZDEFINITION](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/0ae21571-2299-6407-807c-428668bb6798%28Office.15%29.aspx) structure, which stores the description for the time zone that is used when the start time of a single-instance appointment or meeting request is selected.

## Remarks

Microsoft Office Outlook 2003 or earlier, and solutions that are based on Collaboration Data Objects (CDO) 1.2.1 and that have not run the calendar update tool for Outlook or Microsoft Exchange Server, store the start time and end time of single-instance appointments and meeting requests in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). These clients do not store any information for the time zone in which the appointment or meeting request is created.
  
Versions of Outlook since Microsoft Office Outlook 2007, and solutions based on CDO 1.2.1 that have run the Outlook or Exchange Server calendar update tool use this property to store the time zone for the start time. The **dispidApptTZDefStartDisplay** property shows the appointment or meeting in the original time zone that it was scheduled. It determines whether the start time should be adjusted if the rules of the time zone change. If this property is missing, the current local time zone is assumed. This property is used for display purposes only and is not used in recurrence expansion. 
  
A parser must be careful when it reads a stream obtained from this property, or when it persists **TZDEFINITION** to a stream for commitment to a binary property such as **dispidApptTZDefStartDisplay**. For more information, see [About persisting TZDEFINITION to a stream to commit to a binary property](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/0dec535d-d48f-39a5-97d5-0bd109134b3b%28Office.15%29.aspx).
  
This property specifies time zone information for the **dispidApptStartWhole** ([PidLidAppointmentStartWhole](pidlidappointmentstartwhole-canonical-property.md)) property. The value of **dispidApptTZDefStartDisplay** is used to convert the start date and time from UTC to the local time zone for display purposes. For each **TZRULE** specified by this property, the TZRULE_FLAG_RECUR_CURRENT_TZREG flag must not be set. For example, if the **TZRULE** is the effective rule, the value of the field, **TZRULE** must be "0x0002"; otherwise, it must be "0x0000".
