# MAPI Service Provider Samples

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
This section contains code samples of three MAPI service providers:
  
- [Downloading the Outlook MAPI Samples](downloading-the-outlook-mapi-samples.md)
    
    This topic describes how to download the samples.
    
- [Address Book Provider Sample](address-book-provider-sample.md)
    
    This sample supports a single read-only container for display names and e-mail addresses, which are read from a flat binary file.
    
- [Message Store Provider Sample](message-store-provider-sample.md)
    
    This sample uses directories as folders and OLE 2.0 document files as messages. The sample supports all required features for a default message store.
    
- [Transport Provider Sample](transport-provider-sample.md)
    
    This sample uses files and directories to transmit and receive messages.
    
To run any of these samples on the Windows 7, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows XP, or Windows Server 2003 operating systems, you must first set up the MAPI runtime system. For more information, see [MAPI Programming Overview](mapi-programming-overview.md).
