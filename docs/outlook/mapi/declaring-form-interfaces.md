# Declaring Form Interfaces

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
You can simplify the declarations of your implementations of MAPI form interfaces by using the MAPI_ _interface__METHOD macros, where  _interface_ is a form interface defined in the Mapiform.h header file. You are not required to use these macros, but if you do not, you should take particular care that your declarations conform to the declarations in the Mapiform.h header file. For example, you could declare your form server's form object class like the following: 
  
```cpp
class CMyForm : public IPersistMessage, public IMAPIForm,
                public IMAPIFormAdviseSink
{
public:
    CMyForm(CClassFactory *);    // constructorr takes a class factory object
    ~CMyForm(void);
// MAPI methods that need to be implemented.
    MAPI_IUNKNOWN_METHODS(IMPL);
    MAPI_GETLASTERROR_METHOD(IMPL);
    MAPI_IPERSISTMESSAGE_METHODS(IMPL);
    MAPI_IMAPIFORM_METHODS(IMPL);
    MAPI_IMAPIFORMADVISESINK_METHODS(IMPL);
// Add other implementation specific items.
};

```
