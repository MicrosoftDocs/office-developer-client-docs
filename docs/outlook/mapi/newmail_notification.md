## Remarks

The **NEWMAIL_NOTIFICATION** structure is one of the members of the union of structures included in the **info** member of the [NOTIFICATION](notification.md) structure. When the **info** member of a **NOTIFICATION** structure contains a **NEWMAIL_NOTIFICATION** structure, the **ulEventType** member of the **NOTIFICATION** structure is set to  _fnevNewMail._
  
MAPI uses the **NEWMAIL_NOTIFICATION** structure only as a member of the **NOTIFICATION** structure, which holds information about a notification event for the advise sink.
