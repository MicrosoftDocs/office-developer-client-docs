# PidTagTransmittableDisplayName Canonical Property

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 2013 | Outlook 2016 
  
Contains a recipient's display name in a secure form that cannot be changed.
  
|Property |Value |
|:-----|:-----|
|Associated properties:  <br/> |PR_TRANSMITABLE_DISPLAY_NAME, PR_TRANSMITABLE_DISPLAY_NAME_A, PR_TRANSMITABLE_DISPLAY_NAME_W  <br/> |
|Identifier:  <br/> |0x3A20  <br/> |
|Data type:  <br/> |PT_UNICODE, PT_STRING8  <br/> |
|Area:  <br/> |Address  <br/> |
   
## Remarks

These properties should be implemented by all address book providers. They contain the version of the recipient's display name that is transmitted with the message. For most address book providers these properties have the same value as the **PR_DISPLAY_NAME** ([PidTagDisplayName](pidtagdisplayname-canonical-property.md)) property. Providers that do not have a secure display name return PT_ERROR and MAPI changes the display name by adding quotation marks around the name.
  
A client application can use this property to prevent alteration or "spoofing" of entries. An example of spoofing is transmitting John Doe as John (What a Guy) Doe.
