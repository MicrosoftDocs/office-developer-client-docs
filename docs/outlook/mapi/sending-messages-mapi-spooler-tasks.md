# Sending Messages: MAPI Spooler Tasks

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
The MAPI spooler is involved in the message transmission process when the message store is not tightly coupled with a transport provider, when the tightly coupled store and transport cannot handle a recipient, and when the message requires preprocessing.
  
 **After any necessary preprocessing, the MAPI spooler performs the following steps:**
  
1. If the message is not locked, locks the message by using the [IMsgStore::SetLockState](imsgstore-setlockstate.md) method. 
    
2. Has the transport provider send the message to all recipients that have their **PR_RESPONSIBILITY** ([PidTagResponsibility](pidtagresponsibility-canonical-property.md)) property set to FALSE. 
    
3. Calls the appropriate function ([RemovePreprocessInfo](removepreprocessinfo.md)) for cleaning up any additional information that was added to the message for use during preprocessing if the **PR_PREPROCESS** ([PidTagPreprocess](pidtagpreprocess-canonical-property.md)) property has been set. This function is specified when the transport provider registers its preprocessor function. 
    
4. Calls [IMsgStore::FinishedMsg](imsgstore-finishedmsg.md) method. In **FinishedMsg**, the message store provider:
    
  - Unlocks the message.
    
  - Calls the [IMAPISupport::DoSentMail](imapisupport-dosentmail.md) method to perform outbound hook processing if a messaging hook provider exists. It then copies the message to the folder identified by the entry identifier in the **PR_SENTMAIL_ENTRYID** ([PidTagSentMailEntryId](pidtagsentmailentryid-canonical-property.md)) property, if not superseded by a messaging hook provider's sent message processing. Finally, it deletes the message if the **PR_DELETE_AFTER_SUBMIT** ([PidTagDeleteAfterSubmit](pidtagdeleteaftersubmit-canonical-property.md)) property has been set to TRUE.
