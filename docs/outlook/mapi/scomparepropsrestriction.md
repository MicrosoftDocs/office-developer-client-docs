# SComparePropsRestriction

**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
Describes a compare property restriction, which tests two properties using a relational operator.

```cpp
typedef struct _SComparePropsRestriction
{
  ULONG relop;
  ULONG ulPropTag1;
  ULONG ulPropTag2;
} SComparePropsRestriction;

```

## Members

**relop**
  
> Relational operator to use to compare the two properties. Possible values are as follows:
    
  - RELOP_GE: The comparison is made based on a greater or equal first value.
      
  - RELOP_GT: The comparison is made based on a greater first value.
      
  - RELOP_LE: The comparison is made based on a lesser or equal first value.
      
  - RELOP_LT: The comparison is made based on a lesser first value.
      
  - RELOP_NE: The comparison is made based on unequal values.
      
  - RELOP_RE: The comparison is made based on LIKE (regular expression) values.
      
  - RELOP_EQ: The comparison is made based on equal values.
    
**ulPropTag1**
  
> Property tag of the first property to be compared. 
    
**ulPropTag2**
  
> Property tag of the second property to be compared.
    
## Remarks

The comparison order is  _(property tag 1) (relational operator) (property tag 2)_. The properties to be compared must be of the same type. Attempting to compare properties of different types causes MAPI or the service provider to return the error value MAPI_E_TOO_COMPLEX from the [IMAPITable](imapitableiunknown.md) method to which the structure is passed as a parameter. 
  
The result of a compare property value restriction is undefined when one or both of the properties do not exist. When a client requires well-defined behavior for such a restriction and is not sure whether the property exists, (for example, it is not a required column of a table) it should create an **AND** restriction to join the compare property restriction with an exist restriction. Use an [SExistRestriction](sexistrestriction.md) structure to define the exist restriction and an [SAndRestriction](sandrestriction.md) structure to define the **AND** restriction. 
  
The properties specified in the **ulPropTag1** and **ulPropTag2** members can be multi-valued if the service provider supports it. 
  
For more information about the **SComparePropsRestriction** structure and restrictions in general, see [About Restrictions](about-restrictions.md).
