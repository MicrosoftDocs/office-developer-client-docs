# Best Practices for Fast Shutdown

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
This topic recommends best practices for administrators, MAPI clients, and MAPI providers to use Windows registry settings and the fast shutdown interfaces to minimize data loss during client shutdown.
  
- For a MAPI client to carry out fast shutdown successfully so that provider processes do not incur data loss, the MAPI client should first call the [IMAPIClientShutdown::QueryFastShutdown](imapiclientshutdown-queryfastshutdown.md) method. The client should then proceed with the [IMAPIClientShutdown::NotifyProcessShutdown](imapiclientshutdown-notifyprocessshutdown.md) and [IMAPIClientShutdown::DoFastShutdown](imapiclientshutdown-dofastshutdown.md) methods based on the MAPI subsystem's support for fast shutdown, as indicated by the return value of **IMAPIClientShutdown::QueryFastShutdown**. As a MAPI client, Microsoft Outlook does not call **IMAPIClientShutdown::NotifyProcessShutdown** or **IMAPIClientShutdown::DoFastShutdown** if **IMAPIClientShutdown::QueryFastShutdown** returns an error. If the administrator has disabled fast shutdown in the Windows registry, the MAPI subsystem would return MAPI_E_NO_SUPPORT to **IMAPIClientShutdown::QueryFastShutdown**. In this case, the MAPI subsystem would not inform MAPI providers of an immediate client process exit. Therefore, if a MAPI client disregards this error return code, proceeds to do fast shutdown, and disconnects all external references, all loaded MAPI providers will have data loss. 
    
- MAPI providers should implement the [IMAPIProviderShutdown : IUnknown](imapiprovidershutdowniunknown.md) interface to carry out timely and necessary steps to avoid data loss due to the client disconnecting external references before the client exits. A provider should postpone everything else that is nonessential to saving data to its primary data store. For example, a transport provider should postpone unnecessary background operations that check for new mail, an address book provider should postpone downloading recent changes from its server, and a store provider should postpone maintenance tasks such as compacting or indexing. 
    
- Users who want MAPI clients to exit as soon as they close them should use the default registry setting that enables fast shutdown unless a provider opts out.
    
- Once a MAPI client calls **IMAPIClientShutdown::DoFastShutdown**, it should not make any additional calls to MAPI, including the [MAPIUninitialize](mapiuninitialize.md) function. The client should not use MAPI for the rest of the client process's lifetime. 
    
- A MAPI client should never directly call a provider's **IMAPIProviderShutdown** interface. MAPI clients should always use the [IMAPIClientShutdown : IUnknown](imapiclientshutdowniunknown.md) interface. 
    
- If a MAPI provider needs to ensure that fast shutdown is not used while it is loaded, it should implement the **IMAPIProviderShutdown** interface and return MAPI_E_NO_SUPPORT for the **IMAPIProviderShutdown::QueryFastShutdown** method. However, for MAPI clients such as Outlook, this will cause the client to abandon fast shutdown and take a longer time to shut down.
