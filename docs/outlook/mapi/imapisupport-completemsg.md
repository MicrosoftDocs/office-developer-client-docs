# IMAPISupport::CompleteMsg

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
Performs postprocessing on a message. 
  
```cpp
HRESULT CompleteMsg(
  ULONG ulFlags,
  ULONG cbEntryID,
  LPENTRYID lpEntryID
);
```

## Parameters

 _ulFlags_
  
> [in] Reserved; must be zero.
    
 _cbEntryID_
  
> [in] The byte count in the entry identifier pointed to by the  _lpEntryID_ parameter. 
    
 _lpEntryID_
  
> [in] A pointer to the entry identifier of the message to process.
    
## Return value

S_OK 
  
> The postprocessing was successful.
    
## Remarks

The **IMAPISupport::CompleteMsg** method is implemented for message store provider support objects and is called only by message store providers that are tightly coupled with transport providers. Tightly coupled store providers call **IMAPISupport::CompleteMsg** to instruct the MAPI spooler to postprocess a message. 
  
## Notes to callers

Call **CompleteMsg** only when you are tightly coupled with a transport provider, you can handle all of the message's recipients, and one of the following conditions exists: 
  
- The message was preprocessed.
    
- The message requires postprocessing by the MAPI spooler.
