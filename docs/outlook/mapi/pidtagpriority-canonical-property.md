|:-----|:-----|
|Associated properties:  <br/> |PR_PRIORITY  <br/> |

|Data type:  <br/> |PT_LONG  <br/> |
|Area:  <br/> |E-mail  <br/> |
   
## Remarks

This property and the **PR_IMPORTANCE** ([PidTagImportance](pidtagimportance-canonical-property.md)) property should not be confused. Importance indicates a value to users, while priority indicates the order or speed at which the message should be sent by the messaging system software. Higher priority usually indicates a higher cost. Higher importance usually is associated with a different display by the user interface.
  
The priority of a report message should be the same as the priority of the original message being reported.
  
This property can have exactly one of the following values:
  
PRIO_NONURGENT 
  
> The message is not urgent.
    
PRIO_NORMAL 
  
> The message has normal priority.
    
PRIO_URGENT 
  
> The message is urgent.
