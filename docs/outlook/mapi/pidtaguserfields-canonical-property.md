# PidTagUserFields Canonical Property

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
Contains the name, data type, and other information about a user-defined field.
  
|||
|:-----|:-----|
|Associated properties:  <br/> |PR_USERFIELDS  <br/> |
|Identifier:  <br/> |0x36E3  <br/> |
|Data type:  <br/> |PT_BINARY  <br/> |
|Area:  <br/> |MAPI folder  <br/> |
   
## Remarks

For each item, Outlook stores the definitions of all user-defined fields in the [PidLidPropertyDefinitionStream](pidlidpropertydefinitionstream-canonical-property.md) property of the corresponding **IMessage** object. The **PidLidPropertyDefinitionStream** property contains a binary stream known as [PropertyDefinition](propertydefinition-stream-structure.md), which contains the field definitions. For more information about stream structures for field definitions, see [Stream Structures](stream-structures.md).
  
For each folder, Outlook stores the definitions of all user-defined fields in that folder in the **PidTagUserFields** property of an associated message of the message class IPC.MS.REN.USERFIELDS - each folder presumed to contain no more than one message of this class in its associated contents table. 
  
> [!NOTE]
> The set of user-defined fields in a folder may not necessarily match the sets of user-defined fields in each of its items. 
  
The set of user-defined fields in a folder is displayed in various places in the Outlook UI, such as the folder's Field Chooser. The message's **PidTagUserFields** property contains a binary stream, **FolderUserFields**, which contains the folder field definitions. For more information about stream structures for folder field definitions, see [Folder Fields Stream Structures](folder-fields-stream-structures.md) and the [FolderUserFields Stream Sample](folderuserfields-stream-sample.md).
