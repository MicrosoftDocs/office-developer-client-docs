## Remarks

A Contacts Address Book is an Address Book that contains all the contact items in a Contacts folder that have either an email address or a fax number. Each entry in a Contacts Address Book is associated with either an email address or a fax number. Since a contact item can have up to three email addresses and three fax numbers, a contact item can be represented by up to six entries in the corresponding Contacts Address Book.
  
The purpose of a Contacts Address Book is to support users addressing email messages to contacts in a Contacts folder. The Contacts Address Book provider that Microsoft Outlook 2010 and Microsoft Outlook 2013 support is contab32.dll.
  
The **CONTAB_ENTRYID** structure supports a subset of the information that is present in the underlying MAPI Contact message. It identifies the Contact message that a particular Contacts Address Book entry is associated with. 
  
The **cbeid** and **abeid** fields are only valid when the **ulType** field value is set to CONTAB_DISTLIST or CONTAB_USER. When the **ulType** field value is set to CONTAB_ROOT, CONTAB_SUBROOT, or CONTAB_CONTAINER, the [DIR_ENTRYID](dir_entryid.md) structure should be used instead.
