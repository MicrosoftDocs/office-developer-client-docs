|||
|:-----|:-----|
|Associated properties:  <br/> |PR_ORIGINAL_AUTHOR_EMAIL_ADDRESS, PR_ORIGINAL_AUTHOR_EMAIL_ADDRESS_A, PR_ORIGINAL_AUTHOR_EMAIL_ADDRESS_W  <br/> |
|Identifier:  <br/> |0x007A  <br/> |
|Data type:  <br/> |PT_STRING8, PT_UNICODE  <br/> |
|Area:  <br/> |Server  <br/> |
   
## Remarks

These properties are examples of the address properties for the author of a message. At first submission of the message, the client application should set these properties to the value of the **PR_SENDER_EMAIL_ADDRESS** ([PidTagSenderEmailAddress](pidtagsenderemailaddress-canonical-property.md)) property. It is never changed when the message is forwarded or replied to.
  
The original author properties allow for preservation of information from outside the local messaging domain. When a message arrives from another messaging domain, such as from the Internet, these properties provide a way to ensure that original information is not lost.
