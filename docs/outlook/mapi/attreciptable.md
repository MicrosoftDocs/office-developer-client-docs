# attRecipTable

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
When a recipient table is being encoded, each recipient is encoded as a row of MAPI properties. The format is as follows:â€ƒ
  
 _Row_Seq:_
  
>  _row-count_ _Property_Sequence,_... 
    
    The format of  _Property_Seq_ is the same as in the [attMAPIProps](attmapiprops.md) attribute.
