# PidTagAttachExtension Canonical Property

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
Contains a file name extension that indicates the document type of an attachment. 
  
|||
|:-----|:-----|
|Associated properties:  <br/> |PR_ATTACH_EXTENSION, PR_ATTACH_EXTENSION_A, PR_ATTACH_EXTENSION_W  <br/> |
|Identifier:  <br/> |0x3703  <br/> |
|Data type:  <br/> |PT_STRING8, PT_UNICODE  <br/> |
|Area:  <br/> |Message attachment  <br/> |
   
## Remarks

These properties are set by the client application at submission time. 
  
The messaging system uses **PR_ATTACH_EXTENSION** when converting message attachments (in-route conversion) or launching applications based on attachments in received messages. If the sending client does not provide a value for these properties, the message store handling the attachment is not obligated to generate it. The receiving client should first check for **PR_ATTACH_EXTENSION**, and if it is not provided, should parse the file name extension from the attachment's **PR_ATTACH_FILENAME** ( [PidTagAttachFilename](pidtagattachfilename-canonical-property.md)) or **PR_ATTACH_LONG_FILENAME** ( [PidTagAttachLongFilename](pidtagattachlongfilename-canonical-property.md)) property.
