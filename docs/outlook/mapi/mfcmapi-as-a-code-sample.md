# MFCMAPI as a Code Sample

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
The MFCMAPI sample uses the Messaging API to provide access to MAPI stores through a graphical user interface. After you download this sample, you can use the source files to examine example usage cases for many of the MAPI interfaces and references. For more information, see [MAPI Interfaces](mapi-interfaces.md).

### 

 **To use MFCMAPI as a code sample**
  
In **Solution Explorer**, expand the **MFCMapi** project and examine the files in the **Header Files**, **Resource Files**, and **Source Files** nodes for programming scenarios. 
  
Many method topics in the [MAPI Interfaces](mapi-interfaces.md) section point to MFCMAPI source files for programming examples. For example, in [IMsgStore::GetReceiveFolderTable](imsgstore-getreceivefoldertable.md) you are instructed to look at the function  `CMsgStoreDlg::OnDisplayReceiveFolderTable` in the MsgStoreDlg.cpp file.
