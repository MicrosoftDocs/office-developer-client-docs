# IMAPIControl::Activate

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
Performs a task such as displaying a dialog box or starting a programmatic operation when a client application user clicks the button control.
  
```
HRESULT Activate(
  ULONG ulFlags,
  ULONG_PTR ulUIParam
);
```

## Parameters

 _ulFlags_
  
> [in] Reserved; must be zero.
    
 _ulUIParam_
  
> [in] A handle to the parent window of the dialog box on which the button control appears.
    
## Return value

S_OK 
  
> The button control was successfully activated.
    
## Remarks

The **IMAPIControl::Activate** method performs tasks following a user's click of the button control. After the click occurs, as part of the processing of the display table, MAPI makes a call to **Activate** after first calling [IMAPIControl::GetState](imapicontrol-getstate.md) to determine whether the button is enabled. 
  
For more information about how to implement **Activate** and the other [IMAPIControl : IUnknown](imapicontroliunknown.md) methods, see [Control Object Implementation](control-object-implementation.md).
