|Associated properties:  <br/> |PR_RECIPIENT_CERTIFICATE  <br/> |
|Identifier:  <br/> |0x0C13  <br/> |
|Data type:  <br/> |PT_BINARY  <br/> |
|Area:  <br/> |MAPI Recipient  <br/> |
   
## Remarks

This property is a copy of the recipient's **PR_USER_CERTIFICATE** ([PidTagUserCertificate](pidtagusercertificate-canonical-property.md)) property for use in a report. It can be used to prove to the originator that the recipient actually received the message, which a delivery report does not necessarily indicate.
