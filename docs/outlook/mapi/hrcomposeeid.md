# HrComposeEID

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
Creates a compound entry identifier for an object, usually a message in a message store.

|:-----|:-----|
|Header file:  <br/> |Mapiutil.h  <br/> |
|Implemented by:  <br/> |MAPI  <br/> |
|Called by:  <br/> |Client applications  <br/> |
   
```cpp
HrComposeEID(
  LPMAPISESSION psession,
  ULONG cbStoreRecordKey,
  LPBYTE pStoreRecordKey,
  ULONG cbMsgEID,
  LPENTRYID pMsgEID,
  ULONG FAR * pcbEID,
  LPENTRYID FAR * ppEID
);
```

## Parameters

 _psession_
  
> [in] Pointer to the session in use by the client application. 
    
 _cbStoreRecordKey_
  
> [in] Size, in bytes, of the record key of the message store holding the message or other object. If zero is passed in the  _cbStoreRecordKey_ parameter, the  _ppEID_ parameter points to a copy of the object's entry identifier. 
    
 _pStoreRecordKey_
  
> [in] Pointer to the record key of the message store that contains the message or other object. 
    
 _cbMsgEID_
  
> [in] Size, in bytes, of the entry identifier of the message or other object. 
    
 _pMsgEID_
  
> [in] Pointer to the entry identifier of the object. 
    
 _pcbEID_
  
> [out] Pointer to the size, in bytes, of the returned identifier. 
    
 _ppEID_
  
> [out] Pointer to a pointer to the returned entry identifier. If the value of the  _cbStoreRecordKey_ parameter is greater than zero, the  _ppEID_ parameter points to a pointer to the compound entry identifier that is created. If  _cbStoreRecordKey_ is zero,  _ppEID_ points to a pointer to a copy of the object's entry identifier. 
    
## Return value

None.
  
## Remarks

If the message or other object for which the compound entry identifier is being created resides in a message store, the identifier is created from the object's entry identifier and the store's record key. If the object is not in a store, that is, if the byte count for the store record key passed in  _cbStoreRecordKey_ is zero, the object's entry identifier is simply copied. 
  
The **HrComposeEID** function enables applications to work with objects in multiple stores through the use of compound entry identifiers. An application can call the [HrDecomposeEID](hrdecomposeeid.md) function to split the compound entry identifier into its original constituents.
