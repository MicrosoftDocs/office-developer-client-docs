# Opening the Address Book

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
Call [IMAPISession::OpenAddressBook](imapisession-openaddressbook.md) to open the integrated address book and retrieve a pointer to the MAPI [IAddrBook : IMAPIProp](iaddrbookimapiprop.md) interface. The methods of the **IAddrBook** interface can be used to access entries in all of the containers of each of the address book providers in the profile. 
  
 **OpenAddressBook** might return a warning, MAPI_W_ERRORS_RETURNED, to indicate that there were problems with one or more of the address book providers. Interactive clients should call [IMAPISession::GetLastError](imapisession-getlasterror.md) to retrieve additional error information and display the returned information the first time they call **OpenAddressBook** and it returns a warning. 
  
Noninteractive clients should ignore the warning and proceed as if the method succeeded. The returned **IAddrBook** interface is valid regardless of whether all, some, or none of the address book providers in the profile are running. Therefore, both interactive and noninteractive clients must always remember to release the **IAddrBook** pointer when the session ends.
