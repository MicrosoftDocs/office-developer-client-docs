## Parameters

 _lpEntryList_
  
> [in] Pointer to an [ENTRYLIST](entrylist.md) structure that contains an array of entry identifiers to be validated. 
    
## Return value

TRUE 
  
> One or more of the listed entry identifiers are invalid. 
    
FALSE 
  
> All of the listed entry identifiers are valid.
    
## Remarks

The **FBadEntryList** function determines if the entry identifier list has been correctly generated. An example of an invalid identifier is one for which memory has been incorrectly allocated or an identifier of an incorrect size.
