# Handling Named Property Errors

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
When a request is made to [IMAPIProp::GetIDsFromNames](imapiprop-getidsfromnames.md) or [IMAPIProp::GetNamesFromIDs](imapiprop-getnamesfromids.md) that is too large for the implementer to handle, the error value MAPI_E_TOO_BIG is returned. Callers must divide their request into several requests, calling the appropriate method in a loop. 
  
When a call results in partial success, such as when the request is for names that map to specific identifiers and one or more names cannot be found, **GetNamesFromIDs** returns MAPI_W_ERRORS_RETURNED and places PT_ERROR in the property type for the missing property in the property tag array. 
  
Sometimes a client makes a call to **GetNamesFromIDs** that results in no properties being returned, such as when there are no properties in a specified property set, or when all named properties are of a type excluded by the flags. Clients can expect service providers to: 
  
- Return S_OK.
    
- Set the contents of the property tag array pointer to a newly allocated property tag array with its **cValues** member set to zero. 
    
- Set the contents of the [MAPINAMEID](mapinameid.md) structure array to NULL. 
    
- Set the contents of the count of **MAPINAMEID** structures to zero.
