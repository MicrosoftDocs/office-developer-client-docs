# Installing the Sample Offline State Add-in

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
This topic takes you through the steps to download and install the Sample Offline State Add-in. The Sample Offline State Add-in is a COM add-in that adds an **Offline State** menu to Outlook and utilizes the Offline State API. Through the Offline State menu you can enable or disable state monitoring, check the current state, and change the current state. For more information about how the Offline State Add-in is implemented, see [Setting Up an Offline State Add-in](setting-up-an-offline-state-add-in.md).
