# IMAPIViewAdviseSink::OnPrint

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
Notifies the form viewer of the printing status of a form.
  
```
HRESULT OnPrint(
ULONG dwPageNumber,
HRESULT hrStatus
);
```

## Parameters

 _dwPageNumber_
  
> [in] Number of the last page printed.
    
 _hrStatus_
  
> [in] An HRESULT value indicating the status of the print job. Possible values are:
    
S_FALSE 
  
> The printing job has finished successfully.
    
S_OK 
  
> The printing job is in progress.
    
FAILED

> The notification succeeded.
    
MAPI_E_USER_CANCEL

## Remarks

Form objects call the **IMAPIViewAdviseSink::OnPrint** method while printing to inform the viewer of printing progress. 
  
## Notes to Callers

If the printing job involves multiple pages, you can call **OnPrint** after each page is printed. Set  _dwPageNumber_ to the page currently being printed and  _hrStatus_ to S_OK. When the printing job is complete, call **OnPrint** with  _dwPageNumber_ set to the last page printed and  _hrStatus_ set to S_FALSE.
