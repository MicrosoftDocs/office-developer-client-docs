# IMAPIOffline::GetCapabilities

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
Gets the conditions for which callbacks are supported by an offline object.
  
```
HRESULT GetCapabilities( 
    ULONG *pulCapabilities 
);
```

## Parameters

 _pulCapablities_
  
> [out] A bitmask of the following capability flags:
    
MAPIOFFLINE_CAPABILITY_OFFLINE
  
> The offline object is capable of providing offline notifications.
    
MAPIOFFLINE_CAPABILITY_ONLINE
  
> The offline object is capable of providing online notifications.
    
## Remarks

Upon opening an offline object using **[HrOpenOfflineObj](hropenofflineobj.md)**, a client can query on [IMAPIOfflineMgr](imapiofflinemgrimapioffline.md) to obtain a pointer to an **IMAPIOffline** interface, and call **IMAPIOffline::GetCapabilities** to find out the callbacks supported by the object. The client can then choose to set up callbacks by using **IMAPIOfflineMgr**.
  
Note that, depending on the mail server for an offline object, an object that supports callbacks for going online does not necessarily support callbacks for going offline.
  
Also note that, while an offline object may support callbacks for changes other than online/offline, the Offline State API supports only online/offline changes, and clients must check for only such capabilities.
