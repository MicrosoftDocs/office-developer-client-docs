## Remarks

The **OBJECT_NOTIFICATION** structure is one of the members of the union of structures included in the **info** member of the [NOTIFICATION](notification.md) structure. When the **info** member of a **NOTIFICATION** structure contains an **OBJECT_NOTIFICATION** structure, the **ulEventType** member of the **NOTIFICATION** structure is set to one of the following types of events: 
  
- fnevObjectCreated
    
- fnevObjectModified
    
- fnevObjectDeleted
    
- fnevObjectMoved
    
- fnevObjectCopied
    
- fnevSearchComplete
    
The search complete event, represented by the fnevSearchComplete event type, indicates that the initial search of the domain for one search folder has completed.
  
The following members that contain information about the original object are used only in move and copy events. 
  
- **cbOldID**
    
- **lpOldID**
    
- **cbOldParentID**
    
- **lpOldParentID**
    
These members do not apply to the other types of events.
