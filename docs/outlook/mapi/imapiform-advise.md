# IMAPIForm::Advise

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
Registers a form viewer for notifications about events that affect the form.
  
```cpp
HRESULT Advise(
  LPMAPIVIEWADVISESINK pAdvise,
  ULONG FAR * pulConnection
);
```

## Parameters

 _pAdvise_
  
> [in] A pointer to a view advise sink object to receive the subsequent notifications. 
    
 _pulConnection_
  
> [out] A pointer to a nonzero value that represents a successful notification registration.
    
## Return value

S_OK 
  
> The registration was successful.
    
E_OUTOFMEMORY 
  
> The registration was unsuccessful because of insufficient memory.
    
## Remarks

Form viewers call a form's **IMAPIForm::Advise** method to register for notification when changes occur to the form. 
  
## Notes to implementers

Keep a copy of the view advise sink pointer passed in the  _pAdvise_ parameter so that you can use it to call the appropriate [IMAPIViewAdviseSink](imapiviewadvisesinkiunknown.md) method when an event occurs. Call the view advise sink's [IUnknown::AddRef](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms691379%28VS.85%29.aspx) method to retain the pointer until notification registration is canceled. Set the contents of the  _pulConnection_ parameter to a nonzero number. 
  
Many forms implement a helper object to handle the registration and subsequent notification of events. 
  
For more information about the notification process in general, see [Event Notification in MAPI](event-notification-in-mapi.md).
