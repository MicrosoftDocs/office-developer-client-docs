# RTF_WCSRETINFO

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
This structure provides information about a stream in native format returned from decompressing the body of a message that is encapsulated in compressed Rich Text Format (RTF).
  
## Quick Info

```
typedef struct { 
    ULONG size;    
    ULONG ulStreamFlags; 
} RTF_WCSRETINFO;
```

## Members

 _size_
  
> The size of the **RTF_WCSRETINFO** structure in number of bytes. 
    
 _ulStreamFlags_
  
> This is a value that indicates the format of the native body. This value is only valid if the **MAPI_NATIVE_BODY** flag is passed in the  _ulFlags_ parameter of the [RTF_WCSINFO](rtf_wcsinfo.md) structure that is passed to the [WrapCompressedRTFStreamEx](wrapcompressedrtfstreamex.md) function. This can be one of the following values: 
    
|||
|:-----|:-----|
|MAPI_NATIVE_BODY_TYPE_RTF  <br/> |This value is only used if  _ulFlags_ includes the **MAPI_NATIVE_BODY** flag, and the body is RTF.  <br/> |
|MAPI_NATIVE_BODY_TYPE_PLAIN_TEXT  <br/> |This value is only used if  _ulFlags_ includes the **MAPI_NATIVE_BODY** flag, and the body is plain text format.  <br/> |
|MAPI_NATIVE_BODY_TYPE_HTML  <br/> |This value is only used if  _ulFlags_ includes the **MAPI_NATIVE_BODY** flag, and the body is Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) format.  <br/> |
