# Special Folders in Message Stores

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
Special folders such as the Inbox, Outbox, and search-results folder may be created in advance and protected by the message store provider. If the folders do not exist, MAPI will attempt to create them in the message store by calling the [HrValidateIPMSubtree](hrvalidateipmsubtree.md) function. For more information, see [MAPI Special Folders](mapi-special-folders.md).
