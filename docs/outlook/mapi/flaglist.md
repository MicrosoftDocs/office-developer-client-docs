typedef struct
{
  ULONG cFlags;
  ULONG ulFlags[MAPI_DIM];
} FlagList, FAR * LPFlagList;

```

## Members

 **cFlags**
  
> Count of MAPI-defined flags in the list.
    
 **ulFlags**
  
> An array of flags that provides the status of the name resolution operation for a recipient. The following flags can be set:
    
MAPI_AMBIGUOUS 
  
> The recipient has been resolved, but not to a unique entry identifier. Other address book containers should not try to resolve this recipient. 
    
MAPI_RESOLVED 
  
> The recipient has been resolved to a unique entry identifier. Other address book containers should not try to resolve this recipient. 
    
MAPI_UNRESOLVED 
  
> The entry has not been resolved. Other address book containers should try to resolve this recipient.
    
## Remarks

The **FLAGLIST** structure is used as a parameter to [IABContainer::ResolveNames](iabcontainer-resolvenames.md). Each of the recipients to be resolved is included in an [ADRLIST](adrlist.md) structure. As the address book container attempts to resolve each recipient, it sets the appropriate flag in the corresponding entry in the **FLAGLIST** structure. All of the entries in the **FLAGLIST** structure are in the same order as the entries in the **ADRLIST** structure. This makes it easy to associate a flag setting with a recipient.
