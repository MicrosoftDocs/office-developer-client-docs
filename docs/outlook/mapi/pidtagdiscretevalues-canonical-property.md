|Data type:  <br/> |PT_BOOLEAN  <br/> |
|Area:  <br/> |MAPI non-transmittable  <br/> |
   
## Remarks

This property is used within a nondelivery report when the message could not be delivered to one or more members of a distribution list. Its purpose is to limit retransmission attempts to only those individual members and not the distribution list as a whole. 
  
The recipient table of a nondelivery report contains entries for all recipients to whom the message could not be delivered, and also for the distribution lists, if any, to which they belong. The transport provider should set this property to TRUE for each distribution list entry, and it should copy the **PR_DISPLAY_NAME** ([PidTagDisplayName](pidtagdisplayname-canonical-property.md)), **PR_ENTRYID** ([PidTagEntryId](pidtagentryid-canonical-property.md)), and **PR_SEARCH_KEY** ([PidTagSearchKey](pidtagsearchkey-canonical-property.md)) from the distribution list to **PR_ORIGINAL_DISPLAY_NAME** ([PidTagOriginalDisplayName](pidtagoriginaldisplayname-canonical-property.md)), **PR_ORIGINAL_ENTRYID** ([PidTagOriginalEntryId](pidtagoriginalentryid-canonical-property.md)), and **PR_ORIGINAL_SEARCH_KEY** ([PidTagOriginalSearchKey](pidtagoriginalsearchkey-canonical-property.md)) properties for each member of that distribution list. 
  
 **PR_DISCRETE_VALUES** should not be set for any nondelivery report recipient entry other than a distribution list.
