# Copying a Message Service

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
 **To copy a message service to a profile**
  
- Call [IMsgServiceAdmin::CopyMsgService](imsgserviceadmin-copymsgservice.md).
    
When a message service is copied, the new instance of the service is configured in exactly the same way as the original. Sometimes **CopyMsgService** returns the error MAPI_E_ACCESS_DENIED. The most common cause of this error return is a message service that does not allow itself to be duplicated.
