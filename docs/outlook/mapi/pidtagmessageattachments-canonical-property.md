## Remarks

This property can be excluded in [IMAPIProp::CopyTo](imapiprop-copyto.md) operations or included in [IMAPIProp::CopyProps](imapiprop-copyprops.md) operations. As a property of type PT_OBJECT, it cannot be successfully retrieved by the [IMAPIProp::GetProps](imapiprop-getprops.md) method. Its contents should be accessed by the [IMAPIProp::OpenProperty](imapiprop-openproperty.md) method, requesting the **IID_IMAPITable** interface identifier. Service providers must report it to the [IMAPIProp::GetPropList](imapiprop-getproplist.md) method if it is set, but may optionally report it or not if it is not set. 
  
To retrieve table contents, a client application should call the [IMessage::GetAttachmentTable](imessage-getattachmenttable.md) method. For more information, see [Attachment Tables](attachment-tables.md). 
  
This property can be used for subobject restriction by specifying it in the [SSubRestriction](ssubrestriction.md) structure. This allows the client to limit the view of a container to messages with attachments meeting given criteria. A message qualifies for viewing if at least one row in its attachments table, that is, one attachment, satisfies the subobject restriction.
