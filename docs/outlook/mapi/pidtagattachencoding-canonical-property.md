# PidTagAttachEncoding Canonical Property

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
Contains an ASN.1 object identifier that specifies the encoding for an attachment. 
  
|||
|:-----|:-----|
|Associated properties:  <br/> |PR_ATTACH_ENCODING  <br/> |
|Identifier:  <br/> |0x3702  <br/> |
|Data type:  <br/> |PT_BINARY  <br/> |
|Area:  <br/> |Message attachment  <br/> |
   
## Remarks

This property identifies the algorithm used to transform the data in an attachment.
  
 **Note** The **PR_ATTACH_ENCODING** and **PR_ATTACH_TAG** ( [PidTagAttachTag](pidtagattachtag-canonical-property.md)) properties should not be confused. They are not paired or related. **PR_ATTACH_TAG** identifies the application that originally generated the attachment. "Object" has a much more general meaning in the term object identifier, and in X.400, than in object-oriented programming. 
  
The object identifier syntax and sample object identifiers are defined in the MAPIOID.H header file. Values for **PR_ATTACH_ENCODING** are not limited to those defined in MAPIOID.H. For example, attached Macintosh files can use an identifier such as MacBinary. 
  
For complete information on these object identifiers, see the documentation on ASN.1, X.208, and X.209. The object identifier is found in the application-reference element of the FTBP (File Transfer Body Part) environment.
