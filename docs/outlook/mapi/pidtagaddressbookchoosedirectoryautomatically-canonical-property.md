## Remarks

This property corresponds to the **Choose automatically** setting in the Address Book Options dialog. When this property exists in the IID_CAPONE_PROF profile section and is set to **true**, the Address Book dialog no longer defaults to the container specified by the [SetDefaultDir](iaddrbook-setdefaultdir.md) method, but chooses an address book that Outlook 2010 or Outlook 2013 considers appropriate for the context in which the dialog was displayed. Note that this may result in a poor experience for third-party address book providers.
