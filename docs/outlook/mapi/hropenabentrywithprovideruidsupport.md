HRESULT HrOpenABEntryWithProviderUIDSupport(
  const MAPIUID *pEmsabpUID,
  LPMAPISUP lpSup,

);
```

## Parameters

 _pEmsabpUID_
  
> [in] A pointer to an  _emsabpUID_ parameter that identifies the Exchange address book provider that this function should use to display details on the entry identifier. If the incoming entry identifier is not an Exchange address book provider entry identifier, this parameter is ignored and the function call acts exactly like [IAddrBook::Details](iaddrbook-details.md). If this parameter is NULL or a zero MAPIUID, this function also acts exactly like [IAddrBook::Details](iaddrbook-details.md).
    
 _lpSup_
  
> 
    
 _cbEntryID_
  
> [in] The byte count of the entry identifier specified by the  _lpEntryID_ parameter. 
    
 _lpEntryID_
  
> [in] A pointer to the entry identifier that represents the address book entry to open.
    
 _lpInterface_
  
> [in] A pointer to the interface identifier (IID) of the interface to be used to access the open entry. Passing NULL returns the standard interface of the object. For messaging users, the standard interface is [IMailUser : IMAPIProp](imailuserimapiprop.md). For distribution lists it is [IDistList : IMAPIContainer](idistlistimapicontainer.md), and for containers it is [IABContainer : IMAPIContainer](iabcontainerimapicontainer.md). Callers can set  _lpInterface_ to the appropriate standard interface or an interface in the inheritance hierarchy. 
    
 _ulFlags_
  
> [in] A bitmask of flags that controls the type of the text for the  _lpszButtonText_ parameter. The following flags can be set: 
    
AB_TELL_DETAILS_CHANGE
  
> Indicates that Details returns TRUE if changes are actually made to the address; otherwise, Details returns FALSE.
    
DIALOG_MODAL
  
> Displays the modal version of the common address dialog box. This flag is mutually exclusive with DIALOG_SDI.
    
DIALOG_SDI
  
> Displays the modeless version of the common address dialog box. This flag is mutually exclusive with DIALOG_MODAL.
    
MAPI_UNICODE
  
> The passed-in strings are in Unicode format. If the MAPI_UNICODE flag is not set, the strings are in ANSI format.
    
 _lpulObjType_
  
> [out] A pointer to the type of the opened entry.
    
 _lppUnk_
  
> [out] A pointer to a pointer of the opened entry.
