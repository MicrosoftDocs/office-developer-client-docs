# IMAPIProgress::SetLimits

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
Sets the lower and upper limits for the number of items in the operation, and the flags that control how progress information is calculated for the operation.
  
```
HRESULT SetLimits(
  LPULONG lpulMin,
  LPULONG lpulMax,
  LPULONG lpulFlags
);
```

## Parameters

 _lpulMin_
  
> [in] A pointer to a variable that contains the lower limit of items in the operation.
    
 _lpulMax_
  
> [in] A pointer to a variable that contains the upper limit of items in the operation.
    
 _lpulFlags_
  
> [in] A bitmask of flags that controls the level of operation on which progress information is calculated. The following flag can be set:
    
MAPI_TOP_LEVEL 
  
> Uses the values in the [IMAPIProgress::Progress](imapiprogress-progress.md) method's  _ulCount_ and  _ulTotal_ parameters, which indicate the currently processed item and the total items, respectively, to increment progress on the operation. When this flag is set, the values of the global lower and upper limits have to be set. 
    
## Return value

S_OK 
  
> The call succeeded and has returned the expected value or values.
    
## Remarks

Service providers call the **IMAPIProgress::SetLimits** method to set or clear the MAPI_TOP_LEVEL flag and to set local and global minimum and maximum values. The value of the flag setting affects whether the progress object understands the minimum and maximum values to be local or global. When the MAPI_TOP_LEVEL flag is set, these values are considered global and are used to calculate progress for the entire operation. Progress objects initialize the global minimum value to 1 and the global maximum value to 1000. 
  
When MAPI_TOP_LEVEL is not set, the minimum and maximum values are considered local, and providers use them internally to display progress for lower level subobjects. Progress objects save the local minimum and maximum values only so that they can be returned to providers when the [IMAPIProgress::GetMin](imapiprogress-getmin.md) and [IMAPIProgress::GetMax](imapiprogress-getmax.md) methods are called.
