# attDate Attributes

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
All MAPI properties relating to dates and times are mapped to TNEF attributes that have the **attDate** prefix. These are all encoded as **DTR** structures. The dates and times for attachment attributes are encoded as **DTR** structures as well.

A **DTR** structure is very similar to the **SYSTEMTIME** structure defined in the Win32 header files. The **DTR** structure is encoded in the TNEF stream as **sizeof(DTR)** bytes starting with the first member of the structure. The **DTR** structure is defined in the TNEF.H header file.
