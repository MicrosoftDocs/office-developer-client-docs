# attAttachRenddata

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
The **attAttachRenddata** attribute is encoded as a **RENDDATA** structure that describes how and where the attachment is rendered in the message text. The **RENDDATA** structure is simply encoded in the TNEF stream as **sizeof(RENDDATA)** bytes beginning with the first member of the **RENDDATA** structure. If the value of the **RENDDATA** structure's **dwFlags** member is set to **MAC_BINARY**, then the data for the following attachment is stored in MacBinary format; otherwise, the attachment data is encoded as usual.
