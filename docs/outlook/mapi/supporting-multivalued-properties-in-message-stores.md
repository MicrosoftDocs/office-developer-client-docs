# Supporting Multivalued Properties in Message Stores

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
The requirements for supporting properties that have multiple values are documented in [MAPI Property Overview](mapi-property-overview.md). Multiple-value property support is not required for message store providers, but it is recommended, particularly for default message store providers. Some other features, such as folder form libraries, do require multiple-value property support.
