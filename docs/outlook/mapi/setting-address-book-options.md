# Setting Address Book Options

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
You can set three properties that describe options for using the address book:
  
- **PR_AB_SEARCH_PATH** ([PidTagAbSearchPath](pidtagabsearchpath-canonical-property.md))
    
    The **PR_AB_SEARCH_PATH** property is used by [IAddrBook::ResolveName](iaddrbook-resolvename.md) to determine the containers to be involved in name resolution and the order that they should be involved. For each container in **PR_AB_SEARCH_PATH**, **IAddrBook::ResolveName** calls its [IABContainer::ResolveNames](iabcontainer-resolvenames.md) method. Containers at the beginning of **PR_AB_SEARCH_PATH** are searched before containers at the end of **PR_AB_SEARCH_PATH**. 
    
    The search order in **PR_AB_SEARCH_PATH** is specified using an [SRowSet](srowset.md) structure, the same structure that is used to represent rows in a table. You can view the current search path by calling the [IAddrBook::GetSearchPath](iaddrbook-getsearchpath.md) method and change it by calling the [IAddrBook::SetSearchPath](iaddrbook-setsearchpath.md) method. 
    
- **PR_AB_DEFAULT_DIR** ([PidTagAbDefaultDir](pidtagabdefaultdir-canonical-property.md))
    
    The **PR_AB_DEFAULT_DIR** property is the entry identifier of the address book container to be displayed initially when the address book is displayed. The default directory setting remains in effect until you change it by calling the [IAddrBook::SetDefaultDir](iaddrbook-setdefaultdir.md) method. You can view the default directory by calling the [IAddrBook::GetDefaultDir](iaddrbook-getdefaultdir.md) method. 
    
- **PR_AB_DEFAULT_PAB** ([PidTagAbDefaultPab](pidtagabdefaultpab-canonical-property.md))
    
These three properties are special because you cannot work with them using the standard **IMAPIProp** methods. Instead, you must use **IAddrBook** methods. Because none of these properties can be changed with **IMAPIProp::SetProps**, there is no need to call **IMAPIProp::SaveChanges** to make changes permanent. Modifications made through the **IAddrBook** methods take effect immediately.
