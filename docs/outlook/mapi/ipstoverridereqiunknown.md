## Remarks

The PST Override Handler Interface Identifiers might not be defined in the downloadable header file you currently have, in which case you will find them in the [MAPI Constants](mapi-constants.md) topic, and can copy and add them to your code. Use the DEFINE_GUID macro defined in the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) header file guiddef.h to associate globally unique identifier (GUID) symbolic names with their values. 
  
For more information see [How to implement a PST override handler to bypass the PSTDisableGrow policy in Outlook 2007](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/956070).
