# HRESULT

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
A 32-bit value that is used to describe an error or warning.
  
```
typedef LONG HRESULT;
```

## Remarks

The **HRESULT** data type is the same as the [SCODE](scode.md) data type. 
  
An **HRESULT** value consists of the following fields: 
  
- A 1-bit code indicating severity, where zero represents success and 1 represents failure.
    
- A 4-bit reserved value.
    
- An 11-bit code indicating responsibility for the error or warning, also known as a facility code.
    
- A 16-bit code describing the error or warning.
    
Most MAPI interface methods and functions return **HRESULT** values to provide detailed cause formation. **HRESULT** values are also used widely in OLE interface methods. OLE provides several macros for converting between **HRESULT** values and **SCODE** values, another common data type for error handling. 
  
> [!NOTE]
> In 64-bit MAPI, **HRESULT** is still a 32-bit value. 
  
For information about the OLE use of **HRESULT** values, see the  *OLE Programmer's Reference*  . For more information about the use of these values in MAPI, see [Error Handling](error-handling-in-mapi.md) and any of the following interface methods: 
  
[IABLogon::GetLastError](iablogon-getlasterror.md)
  
[IMAPISupport::GetLastError](imapisupport-getlasterror.md)
  
[IMAPIControl::GetLastError](imapicontrol-getlasterror.md)
