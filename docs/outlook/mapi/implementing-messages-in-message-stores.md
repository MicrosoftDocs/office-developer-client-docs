# Implementing Messages in Message Stores

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
The [IMessage : IMAPIProp](imessageimapiprop.md) interface is similar to the [IMAPIFolder : IMAPIContainer](imapifolderimapicontainer.md) interface in that both interfaces derive from the [IMAPIProp : IUnknown](imapipropiunknown.md) interface. Clients use the **IMAPIProp** methods to access the contents of a message. The **IMessage** interface supplies additional methods for manipulating messages (for example, adding attachments or modifying the recipients of a message). The methods in the **IMessage** interface modify attributes of messages that are not stored directly in the message's properties.
