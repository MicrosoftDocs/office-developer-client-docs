# Implementing Folders in Message Stores

 **Last modified:** July 23, 2011 
  
 * **Applies to:** Outlook * 
  
A great deal of the information that relates to message store provider support for folders is covered in [MAPI Folders](mapi-folders.md). You should be familiar with that information before attempting to implement a message store provider. The [MAPI Folders](mapi-folders.md) section is heavily oriented to the MAPI client's perspective; this topic covers additional information that is important from the message store provider's point of view.
