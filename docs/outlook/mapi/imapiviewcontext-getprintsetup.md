# IMAPIViewContext::GetPrintSetup

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
Retrieves current printing information.
  
```cpp
HRESULT GetPrintSetup(
ULONG ulFlags,
LPFORMPRINTSETUP FAR * lppFormPrintSetup
);
```

## Parameters

 _ulFlags_
  
> [in] Bitmask of flags that controls the type of the returned strings. The following flag can be set:
    
MAPI_UNICODE 
  
> The returned strings are in Unicode format. If the MAPI_UNICODE flag is not set, the strings are in ANSI format.
    
 _lppFormPrintSetup_
  
> [out] Pointer to a pointer to a structure that holds the printing information.
    
## Return value

S_OK 
  
> The printing information was successfully retrieved.
    
## Remarks

Form objects call the **IMAPIViewContext::GetPrintSetup** method to retrieve information about the printer setup before attempting to print the current message. 
  
## Notes to implementers

Allocate the **hDevMode** and **hDevName** members of the [FORMPRINTSETUP](formprintsetup.md) structure using the Win32 function **GlobalAlloc**.
  
## Notes to callers

If you expect the **hDevMode** and **hDevName** members of the **FORMPRINTSETUP** structure pointed to by the  _lppFormPrintSetup_ parameter to be Unicode strings, set  _ulFlags_ to MAPI_UNICODE. Otherwise, **GetPrintSetup** will return these strings in ANSI format. 
  
Free the **hDevMode** and **hDevName** members of the **FORMPRINTSETUP** structure by calling the Win32 function **GlobalFree**. Free the entire **FORMPRINTSETUP** structure by calling [MAPIFreeBuffer](mapifreebuffer.md).
