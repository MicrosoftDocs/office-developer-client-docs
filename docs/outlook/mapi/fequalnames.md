|Header file:  <br/> |Mapiutil.h  <br/> |
|Implemented by:  <br/> |MAPI  <br/> |
|Called by:  <br/> |Client applications and service providers  <br/> |
   
```cpp
BOOL FEqualNames(
  LPMAPINAMEID lpName1,
  LPMAPINAMEID lpName2
);
```

## Parameters

 _lpName1_
  
> [in] Pointer to a [MAPINAMEID](mapinameid.md) structure describing the first named property. 
    
 _lpName2_
  
> [in] Pointer to a **MAPINAMEID** structure describing the second named property. 
    
## Return value

TRUE 
  
> The two property names are equal. 
    
FALSE 
  
> The two property names are not equal.
    
## Remarks

The **FEqualNames** function is useful because the **MAPINAMEID** structure contains a [GUID](guid.md) and can represent the property name itself in more than one way. This means the two structures cannot be compared by simple binary methods. 
  
The testing process is case-sensitive for the property name strings.
