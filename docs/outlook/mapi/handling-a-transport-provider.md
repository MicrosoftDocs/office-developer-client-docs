# Handling a Transport Provider

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
Clients communicate with transport providers through status objects supplied by transport providers and the MAPI spooler. Clients access status objects by calling [IMAPISession::GetStatusTable](imapisession-getstatustable.md) to retrieve the status table. Status objects implement the [IMAPIStatus : IMAPIProp](imapistatusimapiprop.md) interface, which has methods for configuring providers, flushing incoming and outgoing message queues, setting passwords, and state validation. For more information about status objects, see [Status Table and Status Objects](status-table-and-status-objects.md).
