HRESULT HrGetAutoDiscoverXML( 
    __in_z const WCHAR *pwzAddress, 
    __in_opt_z const WCHAR *pwzPassword, 
    __in_opt HANDLE hCancelEvent,

## Parameters

 _pwzAddress_
  
> [in] A null-terminated Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) email address of the account for which you want to retrieve the auto-discovery information.
    
 _pwzPassword_
  
> [in] An optional password for the account specified by  _pwzAddress_. Note that passing any password has no effect if the account specified by  _pwzAddress_ does not require a password. 
    
 _hCancelEvent_
  
> [in] An unset Win32 event handle that is optional and can be used to cancel the operation. To cancel the operation, set the event and pass the event handle as  _hCancelEvent_; pass **null** if you do not want to cancel the operation. Note that passing a value that does not represent an event handle has no effect and is ignored by the function. 
    
 _ulFlags_
  
> [in] This parameter is not used. It must be 0.
    
 _ppXmlStream_
  
> [out] A pointer to an [IStream](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa380034%28VS.85%29.aspx) object that contains the autodiscovery XML. Returns **null** if the autodiscovery operation fails. You must release the [IStream](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa380034%28VS.85%29.aspx) object when you are finished with it.
