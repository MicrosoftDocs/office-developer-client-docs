# IAddrBook::SetSearchPath

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
Sets a new search path in the profile that is used for the name resolution process. 
  
```
HRESULT SetSearchPath(
  ULONG ulFlags,
  LPSRowSet lpSearchPath
);
```

## Parameters

 _ulFlags_
  
> [in] Reserved; must be zero.
    
 _lpSearchPath_
  
> [in] A pointer to the [SRowSet](srowset.md) structure used to hold the search path. The first property for each **aRow** member in **SRowSet** must be **PR_ENTRYID** ( [PidTagEntryId](pidtagentryid-canonical-property.md)).
    
## Return value

S_OK 
  
> The search path was successfully set.
    
MAPI_E_MISSING_REQUIRED_COLUMN 
  
> One of the containers described in the **SRowSet** structure did not include its **PR_ENTRYID** property. 
    
## Remarks

Clients and service providers call the **SetSearchPath** method to save changes that were made to the container search order that is used to resolve names with the [IAddrBook::ResolveName](iaddrbook-resolvename.md) method. The search path is saved between instances of a session. 
  
Clients and providers do not have to call the [IMAPIProp::SaveChanges](imapiprop-savechanges.md) method to make the search path changes permanent.
