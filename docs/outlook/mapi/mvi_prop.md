```cpp
MVI_PROP (tag)
```

## Parameters

 _tag_
  
> The property tag to be modified.
    
## Remarks

The MVI_FLAG combines the setting of MV_FLAG, identifying a property as multi-valued, and MV_INSTANCE, requesting that a multi-valued property be displayed in a table in multiple rows. The property type of the affected property is modified, but the identifier remains unchanged. 
  
For example, when the MVI_PROP macro is applied to a property of type PT_FLOAT, its type is changed to PT_MV_FLOAT. When included in a table, multiple rows are used to represent the property that has one row for each value. The properties for the other columns are repeated. 
  
For more information about these flags, see [MAPI Property Type Overview](mapi-property-type-overview.md) and [Working with Multivalued Columns](working-with-multivalued-columns.md).
