 **ulSize**
  
> The size of structure.
    
 **ulCreateFlags**
  
> It must be 0.
    
 **pwszProfileName**
  
> The name of the profile.
    
 **ulCapabilities**
  
> A bit mask of the following capability flags.
    
|||
|:-----|:-----|
|MAPIOFFLINE_CAPABILITY_OFFLINE  <br/> |The offline object is capable of going offline.  <br/> |
|MAPIOFFLINE_CAPABILITY_ONLINE  <br/> |The offline object is capable of going online.  <br/> |
   
 **pGUID**
  
> Pointer to a GUID that is used to uniquely identify this type of offline object from other offline objects. GUID_GlobalState refers to the global offline object that objects can use as a parent object.
    
 **pInstance**
  
> Pointer to GUID that uniquely identifies this offline object. It is used to disambiguate this offline objects from other objects.
    
 **pParent**
  
> Pointer to offline object that is the parent of this offline object and whose changes this offline object will inherit.
    
 **pMAPISupport**
  
>  Identifies the MAPI support object that that will use this offline object. For example, if this offline object is used to keep track of a store's offline and online state, then this is the stores support object. However, if this is an offline object for an object with no support object then it can be NULL. 
    
 **pAggregateInfo**
  
> A pointer to a MAPIOFFLINE_AGGREGATEINFO structure. For more information, see [MAPIOFFLINE_AGGREGATEINFO](mapioffline_aggregateinfo.md).
    
 **pConnectInfo**
  
> Must be null.
