# PidTagResponsibility Canonical Property

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
Contains TRUE if some transport provider has already accepted responsibility for delivering the message to this recipient, and FALSE if the MAPI spooler considers that this transport provider should accept responsibility.

|:-----|:-----|
|Associated properties:  <br/> |PR_RESPONSIBILITY  <br/> |
|Identifier:  <br/> |0x0E0F  <br/> |
|Data type:  <br/> |PT_BOOLEAN  <br/> |
|Area:  <br/> |MAPI non-transmittable  <br/> |
   
## Remarks

When the MAPI spooler presents an outbound message to a transport provider, through [IXPLogon::SubmitMessage](ixplogon-submitmessage.md), it sets this property to FALSE for all recipients for which the MAPI spooler considers that transport provider responsible, and TRUE for all other recipients. The transport provider should attempt to handle all recipients with **PR_RESPONSIBILITY** set to FALSE. After successfully sending, or conclusively failing to send, to a recipient, the transport provider should set this property to TRUE in the source message to indicate that it has accepted responsibility for that recipient. 
  
If, after examining a recipient, a transport provider decides that it cannot or should not handle it, the transport provider should leave **PR_RESPONSIBILITY** set to FALSE. The MAPI spooler will then look for another transport provider that can handle that recipient. The MAPI spooler ultimately creates a nondelivery report for any recipients for which no transport provider accepts responsibility. 
  
If the transport provider attempts and fails to deliver the message, it should call the [IMAPISupport::StatusRecips](imapisupport-statusrecips.md) method to indicate to MAPI the reasons for the failure, so that MAPI can generate a nondelivery report.
