## Return value

The return value is zero when the calling process has read access to all characters up to the terminating null character of the string, or read access up to the number of characters specified by  _cchMax_.
  
The return value is non-zero when the calling process does not have read access to all characters up to the terminating null character of the string, or read access up to the number of characters specified by  _cchMax_.
