SCODE (STDMETHODCALLTYPE FAR * LPFNBUTTON)(
  ULONG_PTR ulUIParam,
  LPVOID lpvContext,
  ULONG cbEntryID,
  LPENTRYID lpSelection,
  ULONG ulFlags
);
```

## Parameters

 _ulUIParam_
  
> [in] Handle of the parent windows for any dialog boxes or windows this function displays.
    
 _lpvContext_
  
> [in] Pointer to an arbitrary value passed to the callback function when MAPI calls it. This value can represent an address of significance to the client application. Typically, for C++ code,  _lpvContext_ represents a pointer to a C++ object. 
    
 _cbEntryID_
  
> [in] Size, in bytes, of the entry identifier pointed to by the  _lpSelection_ parameter. 
    
 _lpSelection_
  
> [in] Pointer to the entry identifier defining the selection in the dialog box.
    
 _ulFlags_
  
> [in] Reserved; must be zero.
    
## Return value

S_OK 
  
> The call succeeded and has returned the expected value or values.
    
## Remarks

Client applications call a callback function based on the **LPFNBUTTON** prototype to define a button in a details dialog box. The client passes a pointer to the callback function in calls to the [IAddrBook::Details](iaddrbook-details.md) method. 
  
Service providers call a hook function based on the **LPFNBUTTON** prototype to define a button in a details dialog box. The provider passes a pointer to this hook function in calls to the [IMAPISupport::Details](imapisupport-details.md) method. 
  
In both cases, when the dialog box is displayed and the user chooses the defined button, MAPI calls **LPFNBUTTON**.
