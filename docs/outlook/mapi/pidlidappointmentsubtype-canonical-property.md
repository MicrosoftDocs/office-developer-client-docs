## Remarks

This property specifies whether or not the event is an all-day event, as specified by the user. A value of TRUE indicates that the event is an all-day event, in which case the start time and end time must be midnight so that the duration is a multiple of 24 hours and is at least 24 hours. A value of FALSE or the absence of this property indicates the event is not an all-day event. The client or server must not infer the value as TRUE when a user happens to create an event that is 24 hours, even if the event starts and ends at midnight.
