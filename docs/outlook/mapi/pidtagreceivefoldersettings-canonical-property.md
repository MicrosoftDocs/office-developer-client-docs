|Data type:  <br/> |PT_OBJECT  <br/> |
|Area:  <br/> |MAPI message store  <br/> |
   
## Remarks

This property can be excluded in [IMAPIProp::CopyTo](imapiprop-copyto.md) operations or included in [IMAPIProp::CopyProps](imapiprop-copyprops.md) operations. As a property of type PT_OBJECT, it cannot be successfully retrieved by the [IMAPIProp::GetProps](imapiprop-getprops.md) method; its contents should be accessed by the [IMAPIProp::OpenProperty](imapiprop-openproperty.md) method, requesting the interface with identifier IID_IMAPITable. Service providers must report it to the [IMAPIProp::GetPropList](imapiprop-getproplist.md) method if it is set, but can optionally report it or not if it is not set. 
  
To retrieve table contents, a client application should call the [IMsgStore::GetReceiveFolderTable](imsgstore-getreceivefoldertable.md) method. For more information, see [Receive Folder Tables](receive-folder-tables.md).
  
This property contains a table of mappings of the receive folders for the message store. Calling **OpenProperty** on this property is equivalent to calling **GetReceiveFolderTable** on the message store.
