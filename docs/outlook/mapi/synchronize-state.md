# Synchronize State

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
 This topic describes what happens during the synchronize state of the replication state machine. 
  
## Quick Info

|||
|:-----|:-----|
|State Identifier:  <br/> |**LR_SYNC** <br/> |
|Related Data Structure:  <br/> |**[SYNC](sync.md)** <br/> |
|From this state:  <br/> |[Idle state](idle-state.md) <br/> |
|To this state:  <br/> |[Download hierarchy state](download-hierarchy-state.md), [synchronize contents state](synchronize-contents-state.md), [upload hierarchy state](upload-hierarchy-state.md), or idle state  <br/> |
   
> [!NOTE]
> The replication state machine is a deterministic state machine. A client departing from one state to another must eventually return to the former from the latter. 
  
## Description

This state initiates synchronization. A local store can transition to an upload or a download state from here. For example, a local store can move to the upload hierarchy state to upload a folder hierarchy to the server, or it can perform a full synchronization by first uploading the hierarchy and then downloading the hierarchy from the server.
  
During this state, Outlook initializes the associated **SYNC** data structure with the path to the local store, so that Outlook sees modifications during other states. 
  
The client sets the [in] members of **SYNC**, which tells Outlook how to handle other states. For example, the client can set  *ulFlags*  to **UPS_UPLOAD_ONLY** and **UPS_THESE_FOLDERS** and  *pel*  to a list of entry identifiers of the folders to tell Outlook that only these folders will be uploaded. When this state ends, the local store reverts to the idle state.
