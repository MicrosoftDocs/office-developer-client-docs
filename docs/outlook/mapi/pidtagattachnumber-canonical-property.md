# PidTagAttachNumber Canonical Property

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
Contains a number that uniquely identifies the attachment within its parent message. 
  
|||
|:-----|:-----|
|Associated properties:  <br/> |PR_ATTACH_NUM  <br/> |
|Identifier:  <br/> |0x0E21  <br/> |
|Data type:  <br/> |PT_LONG  <br/> |
|Area:  <br/> |Message attachment  <br/> |
   
## Remarks

Message stores generate and maintain this property. The attachment number is the secondary sort key, after the rendering position, in the attachment table. 
  
 **PR_ATTACH_NUM** is used to open the attachment with the [IMessage::OpenAttach](imessage-openattach.md) method. Within a client application's session, the **PR_ATTACH_NUM** property of a message attachment remains constant as long as the attachment table is open. 
  
The message store propagates changes to the table using the **IMessage::CreateAttach** and **IMessage::DeleteAttach** methods. At its option the message store can generate table notifications on open attachment tables so that clients can resynchronize to those changes.
