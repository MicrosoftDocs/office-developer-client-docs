# IMsgStore::NotifyNewMail

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
Informs the message store that a new message has arrived. This method is called only by the MAPI spooler.
  
```
HRESULT NotifyNewMail(
  LPNOTIFICATION lpNotification
);
```

## Parameters

 _lpNotification_
  
> [in] A pointer to a [NOTIFICATION](notification.md) structure that describes the new message notification. 
    
## Return value

S_OK 
  
> The message store was successfully notified.
    
## Remarks

The **IMsgStore::NotifyNewMail** method is called by the MAPI spooler to inform the message store that a message is ready for delivery. 
  
## Notes to Implementers

When **NotifyNewMail** is called, send a new mail notification to all registered clients. You can send the notification by calling [IMAPISupport::Notify](imapisupport-notify.md), if you elect to use the support object methods, or by using your own implementation. A registered client is one that has called [IMsgStore::Advise](imsgstore-advise.md) and set the  _lpEntryID_ parameter to NULL and the  _ulEventMask_ parameter to  _fnevNewMail_. 
  
Do not modify or free the memory for the [NOTIFICATION](notification.md) structure that describes the new mail notification. Copy the **NOTIFICATION** structure by calling the utility function [ScCopyNotifications](sccopynotifications.md) to make use of the information in its members.
