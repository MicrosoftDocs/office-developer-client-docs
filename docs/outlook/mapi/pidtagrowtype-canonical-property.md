## Remarks

This property appears only on contents tables. A category only exists when it has items.
  
This property can have exactly one of the following values:
  
TBL_LEAF_ROW 
  
> Represents actual data, rather than a category row.
    
TBL_EMPTY_CATEGORY 
  
> Not currently used.
    
TBL_EXPANDED_CATEGORY 
  
> The category is expanded; the user interface usually displays this with the minus sign ( - ) next to it.
    
TBL_COLLAPSED_CATEGORY 
  
> The category is collapsed; the user interface usually displays this with the plus sign (+) next to it.
