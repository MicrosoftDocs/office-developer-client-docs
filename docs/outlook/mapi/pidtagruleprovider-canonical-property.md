|Associated properties:  <br/> |PR_RULE_PROVIDER, PR_RULE_PROVIDER_A , PR_RULE_PROVIDER_W  <br/> |

|Data type:  <br/> |PT_STRING8, PT_UNICODE  <br/> |

## Remarks

Deferred actions need these properties to identify the code that must interpret and execute the rule action.
  
Rules stored on mailboxes and folders are associated with the application that owns them by a rule provider string. A rule provider sets and handles rules in a rule table. It also provides a means of handling any deferred actions if such rules are set. Deferred actions are created implicitly by the information store. For move or copy operations to a different store, if a provider sets a deferred action rule, it must provide a handler to perform the action when the rule is fired and a deferred action is created.
