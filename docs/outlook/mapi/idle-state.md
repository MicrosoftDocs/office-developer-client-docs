# Idle State

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
 This topic describes what happens during the idle state of the replication state machine. 
  
## Quick info

|||
|:-----|:-----|
|State Identifier:  <br/> |**LR_SYNC_IDLE** <br/> |
|Related Data Structure:  <br/> | *None*  <br/> |
|From this state:  <br/> | *Not applicable*  <br/> |
|To this state:  <br/> |[Synchronize state](synchronize-state.md) <br/> |
   
> [!NOTE]
> The replication state machine is a deterministic state machine. A client departing from one state to another must eventually return to the former from the latter. 
  
## Description

Nothing happens in this state. A local store is in this state before replication is initiated and after replication is complete.
