## Remarks

This property is used by the [IExchangeModifyTable](iexchangemodifytableiunknown.md) interface to uniquely identify a person or role to whom the SACL applies. After a member is created in the SACL table, the **ENTRYID** cannot be changed. To change it, you must delete the table member and re-create it with a different **ENTRYID**.
