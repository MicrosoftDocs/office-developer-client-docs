|Identifier:  <br/> |0x0E1D  <br/> |
|Data type:  <br/> |PT_STRING8, PT_UNICODE  <br/> |

## Remarks

These properties are computed by message store or transport providers from the **PR_SUBJECT** ([PidTagSubject](pidtagsubject-canonical-property.md)) and **PR_SUBJECT_PREFIX** ([PidTagSubjectPrefix](pidtagsubjectprefix-canonical-property.md)) properties in the following manner.
  
- If the **PR_SUBJECT_PREFIX** is present and is an initial substring of **PR_SUBJECT**, **PR_NORMALIZED_SUBJECT** and associated properties are set to the contents of **PR_SUBJECT** with the prefix removed. 
    
- If **PR_SUBJECT_PREFIX** is present, but it is not an initial substring of **PR_SUBJECT**, **PR_SUBJECT_PREFIX** is deleted and recalculated from **PR_SUBJECT** using the following rule: If the string contained in **PR_SUBJECT** begins with one to three non-numeric characters followed by a colon and a space, then the string together with the colon and the blank becomes the prefix. Numbers, blanks, and punctuation characters are not valid prefix characters. 
    
- If **PR_SUBJECT_PREFIX** is not present, it is calculated from **PR_SUBJECT** using the rule outlined in the previous step. This property then is set to the contents of **PR_SUBJECT** with the prefix removed. 
    
 **Note** When **PR_SUBJECT_PREFIX** is an empty string, **PR_SUBJECT** and this property are the same. 
  
Ultimately, this property should be the part of **PR_SUBJECT** following the prefix. If there is no prefix, this property becomes the same as **PR_SUBJECT**.
  
 **PR_SUBJECT_PREFIX** and this property should be computed as part of the [IMAPIProp::SaveChanges](imapiprop-savechanges.md) implementation. A client application should not prompt the [IMAPIProp::GetProps](imapiprop-getprops.md) method for their values until they have been committed by an **IMAPIProp::SaveChanges** call. 
  
The subject properties are typically small strings of fewer than 256 characters, and a message store provider is not obligated to support the Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) **IStream** interface on them. The client should always attempt access through the **IMAPIProp** interface first, and resort to **IStream** only if MAPI_E_NOT_ENOUGH_MEMORY is returned.
