# IMAPIMessageSite::DeleteMessage

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
Deletes the current message.
  
```cpp
HRESULT DeleteMessage(
  LPMAPIVIEWCONTEXT pViewContext,
  LPCRECT prcPosRect
);
```

## Parameters

 _pViewContext_
  
> [in] A pointer to a view context object.
    
 _prcPosRect_
  
> [in] A pointer to a [RECT](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd162897%28VS.85%29.aspx) structure that contains the current form's window size and position. The next form displayed also uses this window rectangle. 
    
## Return value

S_OK 
  
> The call succeeded and has returned the expected value or values.
    
MAPI_E_NO_SUPPORT 
  
> The operation is not supported by this message site.
    
## Remarks

A form object calls the **IMAPIMessageSite::DeleteMessage** method to delete the message that the form is currently displaying. 
  
## Notes to callers

Following the return of **DeleteMessage**, form objects must check for a new message and then dismiss themselves if none exists. To determine whether the message **DeleteMessage** acted on was deleted or moved to a **Deleted Items** folder, a form object can call the [IMAPIMessageSite::GetSiteStatus](imapimessagesite-getsitestatus.md) method to determine whether the DELETE_IS_MOVE flag was returned. 
  
## Notes to implementers

If a form viewer's implementation of the **DeleteMessage** method moves to the next message after it deletes a message, the implementation should call the [IMAPIViewContext::ActivateNext](imapiviewcontext-activatenext.md) method and pass the VCDIR_DELETE flag before performing the actual deletion. If a form viewer's implementation of **DeleteMessage** moves the deleted message (for example, to a **Deleted Items** folder), the implementation must save changes to the message if the message was modified. 
  
A typical implementation of **DeleteMessage** performs the following tasks: 
  
1. If the implementation is moving the message, it calls the [IPersistMessage::Save](ipersistmessage-save.md) method, passing **null** in the  _pMessage_ parameter and **true** in the  _fSameAsLoad_ parameter. 
    
2. It calls the **IMAPIViewContext::ActivateNext** method, passing the VCDIR_DELETE flag in the  _ulDir_ parameter. 
    
3. If the **ActivateNext** call fails, it returns. If **ActivateNext** returns S_FALSE, it calls the [IPersistMessage::HandsOffMessage](ipersistmessage-handsoffmessage.md) method. 
    
4. It deletes or moves the message.
    
To obtain the **RECT** structure used by a form's window, call the Windows [GetWindowRect](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms633519) function.
