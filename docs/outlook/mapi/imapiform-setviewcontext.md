# IMAPIForm::SetViewContext

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
Establishes a view context for the form. 
  
```cpp
HRESULT SetViewContext(
  LPMAPIVIEWCONTEXT pViewContext
);
```

## Parameters

 _pViewContext_
  
> [in] A pointer to the new view context for the form.
    
## Return value

S_OK 
  
> The view context was successfully set.
    
## Remarks

Form viewers call the **IMAPIForm::SetViewContext** method to establish a particular form view context as current. A form can have only one view context at a time. 
  
## Notes to implementers

Most form servers implement **SetViewContext** by using the following algorithm: 
  
- If a view context already exists for the form, cancel the form's registration by calling the [IMAPIViewContext::SetAdviseSink](imapiviewcontext-setadvisesink.md) method with **null** in the  _pmnvs_ parameter, and then call the view context's [IUnknown::Release](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms682317%28v=VS.85%29.aspx) method to decrement its reference count. 
    
- If the new view context is not **null**, call **IMAPIViewContext::SetAdviseSink** by using the  _pViewContext_ parameter to set up a new view advise sink. 
    
- If the new view context is not **null**, call the [IMAPIViewContext::GetViewStatus](imapiviewcontext-getviewstatus.md) method to determine which status flags have been set. 
    
- If the new view context is not **null**, store it and call its [IUnknown::AddRef](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms691379%28VS.85%29.aspx) method to increment its reference count. 
    
- Update any user interface elements that depend on the view context. 
    
Depending on the status flags returned from **IMAPIViewContext::GetViewStatus**, **SetViewContext** can also perform other actions. For example, if the VCSTATUS_NEXT and VCSTATUS_PREV flags are returned, **SetViewContext** can enable the **Next** and **Previous** buttons for the new view context.
