# Accessing the Members of a Distribution List

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
 **To get the members of a distribution list**
  
1. Create a sized property tag array with the properties of the members you would like to retrieve, such as **PR_ENTRYID** ( [PidTagEntryId](pidtagentryid-canonical-property.md)), **PR_DISPLAY_NAME** ( [PidTagDisplayName](pidtagdisplayname-canonical-property.md)), and **PR_DISPLAY_TYPE** ( [PidTagDisplayType](pidtagdisplaytype-canonical-property.md)).
    
2. Call [IAddrBook::OpenEntry](iaddrbook-openentry.md) to open the distribution list. 
    
3. Call the distribution list's **IABContainer::GetContentsTable** method to access its contents table. 
    
4. Call [HrQueryAllRows](hrqueryallrows.md) to retrieve all of the table's rows representing the members of the distribution list.
