# IMAPISupport::GetMemAllocRoutines

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
Retrieves the addresses of the MAPI memory allocation and deallocation functions ([MAPIAllocateBuffer](mapiallocatebuffer.md), [MAPIAllocateMore](mapiallocatemore.md), and [MAPIFreeBuffer](mapifreebuffer.md)).
  
```
HRESULT GetMemAllocRoutines(
  LPALLOCATEBUFFER FAR * lppAllocateBuffer,
  LPALLOCATEMORE FAR * lppAllocateMore,
  LPFREEBUFFER FAR * lppFreeBuffer
);
```

## Parameters

 _lppAllocateBuffer_
  
> [out] A pointer to a pointer to the **MAPIAllocateBuffer** function. **MAPIAllocateBuffer** allocates memory. 
    
 _lppAllocateMore_
  
> [out] A pointer to a pointer to the **MAPIAllocateMore** function. **MAPIAllocateMore** allocates additional memory for memory that was originally allocated by using **MAPIAllocateBuffer**.
    
 _lppFreeBuffer_
  
> [out] A pointer to a pointer to the **MAPIFreeBuffer** function. **MAPIFreeBuffer** frees memory. 
    
## Return value

S_OK 
  
> The function addresses were successfully returned.
    
## Remarks

The **IMAPISupport::GetMemAllocRoutines** method is implemented for all support objects. Service providers call **GetMemAllocRoutines** to get the addresses of the three memory allocation functions that are passed to their initialization function ( [ABProviderInit](abproviderinit.md), [MSProviderInit](msproviderinit.md), or [XPProviderInit](xpproviderinit.md)).
