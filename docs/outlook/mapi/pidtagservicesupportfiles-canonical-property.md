|Identifier:  <br/> |0x3D0F  <br/> |

|Area:  <br/> |MAPI profile  <br/> |
   
## Remarks

Using a dialog box in the control panel applet, a user can obtain the list of files that belong to the message service. For example, the user can obtain the names of all dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) that belong to the service. The user can then seek additional details about the specified files, such as the names and version numbers of all the DLLs. MAPI uses the these properties to create a support file list in a dialog box for messaging user selection.
  
MAPI works only with filenames, and other strings passed to it, in the Active Directory Service Interfaces (ANSI) character set. Client applications that use filenames in an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) character set must convert them to ANSI before calling MAPI.
