# File Format of Form Configuration Files

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
A form configuration file is a formatted file created by form developers to define a form.
  
Because form configuration files are used by form managers to load forms, each form must be defined using a form configuration file. Form configuration files must have the .cfg filename extension. The file follows the general syntax of a Windows initialization file (.ini file). It is divided into named sections, and each section contains a series of entries and values. Values have one of the following types: string, displayed string, platform string, path, integer, or globally unique identifier, **GUID**. Form configuration files can be created with any text editor or word processor that is capable of saving text files.
