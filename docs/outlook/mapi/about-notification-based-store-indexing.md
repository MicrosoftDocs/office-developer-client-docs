# About Notification-Based Store Indexing

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
A MAPI store provider can specify whether the MAPI Protocol Handler crawls and indexes messages in the store, or whether the store sends notifications to the indexer when there are messages to be indexed. The latter is known as notification-based indexing, and a store that supports notification-based indexing is a known as a pusher store.
  
A store provider that supports notification-based indexing sets the **STORE_PUSHER_OK** flag in the **[PR_STORE_SUPPORT_MASK](pidtagstoresupportmask-canonical-property.md)** property. The MAPI Protocol Handler or a client can get the **PR_STORE_SUPPORT_MASK** property to determine the characteristics of the store. 
  
Whenever there is an attachment, folder, or a message to be indexed, the store provider generates a MAPI Uniform Resource Locator (URL) identifying the object to be indexed and sends it to the indexer. This MAPI URL is encoded in Unicode and must uniquely identify the object to the MAPI Protocol Handler. For more information about MAPI URLs, see [About MAPI URLs for Notification-Based Indexing](about-mapi-urls-for-notification-based-indexing.md).
  
Because an indexer cannot always index everything before a shutdown occurs in a pusher store, the pusher store must persist what needs to be pushed. When a store provider sends a notification about an object that needs to be indexed, it specifies the notification type **fnevIndexing** in the **ulEventType** member of the **[NOTIFICATION](notification.md)** structure. The **info** member of the **NOTIFICATION** structure contains an **[EXTENDED_NOTIFICATION](extended_notification.md)** structure. The store provider identifies the process in the **[PR_SEARCH_OWNER_ID](pidtagsearchownerid-canonical-property.md)** property. It also identifies the process in the [INDEX_SEARCH_PUSHER_PROCESS](index_search_pusher_process.md) structure, and passes this information as part of the **pbEventParameters** member of the **EXTENDED_NOTIFICATION** structure. If the process is shut down or crashes, the MAPI Protocol Handler will be able to immediately detect that and stop indexing the pusher store.
