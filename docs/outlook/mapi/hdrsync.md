# HDRSYNC

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
Information for synchronizing a message header during the [download message header state](download-message-header-state.md).
  
## Quick Info

```
struct HDRSYNC 
{ 
    UPMSG *pupmsg; 
    FEID feidPar; 
    LPSTREAM pstmReserved; 
    ULONG ulFlags; 
    LPMESSAGE pmsgFull; 
};
```

## Members

 _pupmsg_
  
- [out] Information for the current message header in the local store.
    
 _feidPar_
  
- [out] Entry ID for the parent folder of the message item.
    
 _pstmReserved_
  
- [out] This member is reserved for the internal use of Outlook and is not supported. 
    
 _ulFlags_

- HSF_LOCAL
    
  - [in] Full item resides in the same local store as the header item.
