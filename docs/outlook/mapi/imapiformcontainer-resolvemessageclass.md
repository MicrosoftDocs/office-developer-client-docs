# IMAPIFormContainer::ResolveMessageClass

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
Resolves a message class to its form in a form container and returns a form information object for that form.
  
```cpp
HRESULT ResolveMessageClass(
  LPCSTR szMessageClass,
  ULONG ulFlags,
  LPMAPIFORMINFO FAR * ppforminfo
);
```

## Parameters

 _szMessageClass_
  
> [in] A string that names the message class being resolved. Message class names are always ANSI strings, never Unicode.
    
 _ulFlags_
  
> [in] A bitmask of flags that controls how the message class is resolved. The following flag can be set:
    
MAPIFORM_EXACTMATCH 
  
> Only message class strings that are an exact match should be resolved.
    
 _ppforminfo_
  
> [out] A pointer to a pointer to the returned form information object.
    
## Return value

S_OK 
  
> The call succeeded and has returned the expected value or values.
    
MAPI_E_NOT_FOUND 
  
> The message class passed in the  _szMessageClass_ parameter does not match the message class for any form in the form container. 
    
## Remarks

Client applications call the **IMAPIFormContainer::ResolveMessageClass** method to resolve a message class to a form within a form container. The form information object returned in the  _ppforminfo_ parameter provides further access to the properties of the form with the given message class. 
  
## Notes to callers

To resolve a message class to a form, pass in the name of the message class to be resolved (for example,  `IPM.HelpDesk.Software`). To force the resolution to be exact (that is, to prevent resolution to a base class of the message class), the MAPIFORM_EXACTMATCH flag can be passed in the  _ulFlags_ parameter. 
  
The class identifier for the resolved message class is returned as part of the form information object. Do not assume that the class identifier exists in the OLE library until after you call either the [IMAPIFormMgr::PrepareForm](imapiformmgr-prepareform.md) or [IMAPIFormMgr::CreateForm](imapiformmgr-createform.md) method.
