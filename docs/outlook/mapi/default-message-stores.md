# Default Message Stores

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
A default message store is one that client applications can use for general purpose messaging tasks. There are a number of optional features for message store providers that become required if the message store provider is to be used as the default message store. They are as follows:
  
- Implementing the special folders: the Inbox, Outbox, and search-results folders.
    
- Providing read and nonread reports.
    
- Allowing incoming and outgoing message submissions.
    
- Allowing the creation of messages with arbitrary message classes.
    
- Supporting named and multiple-value properties.
    
- Supporting the [IMSProvider::SpoolerLogon](imsprovider-spoolerlogon.md) method, even if the message store provider is tightly coupled with a transport provider. 
    
- Supporting associated contents tables. For more information, see [Contents Tables](contents-tables.md).
    
- Supporting notification of the MAPI spooler when there are messages in the outgoing message queue.
