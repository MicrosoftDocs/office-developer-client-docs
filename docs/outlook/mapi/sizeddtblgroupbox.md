|Header file:  <br/> |Mapidefs.h  <br/> |
|Related structure:  <br/> |**DTBLGROUPBOX** <br/> |
   
```
SizedDtblGroupBox (n, u)
```

## Parameters

 _n_
  
> Length of the group box's label. 
    
 _u_
  
> Name for the new structure.
    
## Remarks

The **SizedDtblGroupBox** macro lets you define a group box control when the length of the label is known. The new structure is created with the following members: 
  
```
DTBLGROUPBOX dtblgroupbox;
TCHAR lpszLabel[n];

```

To use a pointer to the resulting structure from the **SizedDtblGroupBox** macro as a **DTBLGROUPBOX** structure pointer, perform the following cast: 
  
```
lpDtblGroupBox = (LPDTBLGROUPBOX) &amp;SizedDtblGroupBox;

```
