```
SizedDtblComboBox (n, u)
```

## Parameters

 _n_
  
> Number of characters that can be entered in the combo box's edit control. 
    
 _u_
  
> Name for the new structure.
    
## Remarks

The **SizedDtblComboBox** macro lets you define a combo box when the length of the enabled character string is known. The new structure is created with the following members: 
  
```
DTBLCOMBOBOX dtblcombobox;
TCHAR lpszCharsAllowed[n];

```

To use a pointer to the resulting structure from the **SizedDtblComboBox** macro as a **DTBLCOMBOBOX** structure pointer, perform the following cast: 
  
```
lpDtblComboBox = (LPDTBLCOMBOBOX) &amp;SizedDtblComboBox;

```
