# IMAPIOfflineNotify::Notify

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
Sends notifications to the client about changes in connection state.
  
```cpp
void STDMETHODCALLTYPE Notify(  
    const MAPIOFFLINE_NOTIFY * pNotifyInfo 
);
```

## Parameters

 _pNotifyInfo_
  
> [in] The notification that Outlook sends to the client. The notification indicates the part of the connection state that has changed, the old connection state, and the new connection state.
    
## Remarks

Outlook uses this method to send notification callbacks to a client. To make this interface available to Microsoft Outlook 2010 or Microsoft Outlook 2013, the client must implement this interface and pass a pointer to it as a member in **[MAPIOFFLINE_ADVISEINFO](mapioffline_adviseinfo.md)** when setting up callbacks using **[IMAPIOfflineMgr::Advise](imapiofflinemgr-advise.md)**. 
  
The client also passes to **MAPIOFFLINE_ADVISEINFO** a client token that Outlook 2010 or Outlook 2013 uses in **IMAPIOfflineNotify::Notify** to identify the client registered for the notification callback. 
  
In general, Outlook 2010 and Outlook 2013 can notify a client of online/offline changes and other connection state changes, but the Offline State API supports only notifications for online/offline changes. The client must ignore all other notifications.
