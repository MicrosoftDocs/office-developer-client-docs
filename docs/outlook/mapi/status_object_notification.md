## Remarks

The **STATUS_OBJECT_NOTIFICATION** structure is one of the members of the union of structures included in the **info** member of the [NOTIFICATION](notification.md) structure. The **STATUS_OBJECT_NOTIFICATION** structure is included with a status object notification for an event of type  _fnevStatusObjectModified_. Status object notification is an internal MAPI notification; clients and service providers cannot register for it and service providers cannot generate it.
