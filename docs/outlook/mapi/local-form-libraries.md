# Local Form Libraries

 **Last modified:** July 23, 2011 
  
 * **Applies to:** Outlook * 
  
Local form libraries are stored directly on a user's machine, usually in a file called FRMCACHE.DAT. 
  
Client applications can access forms in the local form library without accessing any network resources. Local form libraries are an exception to the rule that forms are stored in associated contents tables, since the local form library is simply a file on disk that is not part of any MAPI folder hierarchy.
