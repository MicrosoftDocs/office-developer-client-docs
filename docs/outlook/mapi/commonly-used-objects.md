# Commonly Used Objects

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
Information about objects is documented in various sections of the Microsoft Outlook 2013 MAPI Reference. Because almost all MAPI objects expose a single MAPI interface, the approach is to treat objects and the interfaces that they expose as synonymous.
  
You can find information about objects and interfaces in the following sections.
  
- [MAPI Interfaces](mapi-interfaces.md)
    
    Describes the interfaces in the Outlook 2013 MAPI Reference. In this section you can, for example, locate information about how to implement and use a folder under its standard interface, **IMAPIFolder**.
    
- [MAPI Object and Interface Overview](mapi-object-and-interface-overview.md)
    
    Introduces the Component Object Model as it relates to MAPI, describes the MAPI object hierarchy and containment model, maps objects to interfaces, and describes implementation responsibilities.
    
- [MAPI Property Overview](mapi-property-overview.md)
    
    Describes how objects manage and clients work with properties.
    
- [MAPI Tables](mapi-tables.md)
    
    Describes in detail how to implement and use a table object, and discusses the composition and purpose of the different types of tables.
    
- [MAPI Forms](mapi-forms.md)
    
    Describes the various objects for the implementation and use of forms.
    
- [MAPI Application Development](mapi-application-development.md)
    
    Provides information about the following types of objects:
    
  - Forms
    
  - Messages
    
  - Attachments
    
  - Recipients
    
  - Status objects
    
  - Profile and message service objects
    
- [Developing a MAPI Client Application](developing-a-mapi-client-application.md)
    
    Describes how to use objects to implement a MAPI client application.
    
- [MAPI Service Providers](mapi-service-providers.md)
    
    Describes how to use support and progress objects and how to implement a status object and display table.
    
- [Developing a MAPI Address Book Provider](developing-a-mapi-address-book-provider.md)
    
    Describes how to implement the address book logon and provider objects, address book containers, messaging users, distribution lists, and related tables.
    
- [Developing a MAPI Transport Provider](developing-a-mapi-transport-provider.md)
    
    Describes how to implement the transport logon and provider objects, status object, Transport Neutral Encapsulation Format (TNEF) object, and folders.
    
- [Developing a MAPI Message Store Provider](developing-a-mapi-message-store-provider.md)
    
    Describes how to implement the message store logon and provider objects, message stores, folders, messages, attachments, recipients, and related tables.
    
- [Developing MAPI Form Servers](developing-mapi-form-servers.md)
    
    Describes how to implement form objects.
