# IMAPITable::CollapseRow

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
Collapses an expanded table category, removing any lower-level headings and leaf rows belonging to the category from the table view.
  
```cpp
HRESULT CollapseRow(
ULONG cbInstanceKey,
LPBYTE pbInstanceKey,
ULONG ulFlags,
ULONG FAR * lpulRowCount
);
```

## Parameters

 _cbInstanceKey_
  
> [in] The count of bytes in the PR_INSTANCE_KEY property pointed to by the  _pbInstanceKey_ parameter. 
    
 _pbInstanceKey_
  
> [in] A pointer to the **PR_INSTANCE_KEY** ([PidTagInstanceKey](pidtaginstancekey-canonical-property.md)) property that identifies the heading row for the category. 
    
 _ulFlags_
  
> Reserved; must be zero.
    
 _lpulRowCount_
  
> [out] A pointer to the total number of rows that are being removed from the table view.
    
## Return value

S_OK 
  
> The collapse operation has succeeded.
    
MAPI_E_NOT_FOUND 
  
> The row identified by the  _pbInstanceKey_ parameter does not exist. 
    
MAPI_E_INVALID_ENTRYID 
  
> The row identified by the  _pbInstanceKey_ parameter does not exist. This error is an alternative to MAPI_E_NOT_FOUND; service providers can return either one. 
    
## Remarks

The **IMAPITable::CollapseRow** method collapses a table category and removes it from the table view. The rows are collapsed starting at the row identified by the **PR_INSTANCE_KEY** property pointed to by the  _pbInstanceKey_ parameter. The number of rows that are removed from the view is returned in the contents of the  _lpulRowCount_ parameter. 
  
Notifications are never generated for table rows that are removed from a view as the result of a collapse operation. 
  
When a row that is defined by a bookmark is collapsed out of view, the bookmark is moved to point to the next visible row.
