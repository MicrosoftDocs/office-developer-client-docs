# Deleting a Recipient

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
 **To remove one or more address book entries from a modifiable container**
  
- Call the [IABContainer::DeleteEntries](iabcontainer-deleteentries.md) method, passing an array of entry identifiers that represent the address book entries to be deleted. **DeleteEntries** can return a warning, MAPI_W_PARTIAL_COMPLETION, to indicate that it couldn't delete one or more of the entries. Test for this return value with the **HR_FAILED** macro and call the container's [IMAPIProp::GetLastError](imapiprop-getlasterror.md) method if more information about the problem is needed. 
    
When you hold a pointer to a deleted entry's [ADRENTRY](adrentry.md) structure in your cache, you will still be able to retrieve properties using its entry identifier. This is because the entry is only marked for deletion. MAPI maintains a level of access to these marked entries by design.
