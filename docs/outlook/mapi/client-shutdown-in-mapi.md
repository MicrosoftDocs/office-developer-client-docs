# Client Shutdown in MAPI 
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 2013 | Outlook 2016 
  
Beginning in Microsoft Outlook 2010 and now including Microsoft Outlook 2013, MAPI clients can shut down the same way as before, or they can use fast shutdown. For fast shutdown to occur successfully, the MAPI client, MAPI provider, and administrator of the client computer have to support fast shutdown. 
  
The topics in this section describe MAPI support for a client to perform fast shutdown.
