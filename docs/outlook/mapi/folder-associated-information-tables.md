# Folder-Associated Information Tables

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
MAPI defines the MAPI_ASSOCIATED flag for various MAPI components to use when dealing with associated information tables. Each folder in a message store should have an associated contents table along with its standard contents table. Client applications store special messages in a folder's associated contents table to hold forms and views. In fact, to support forms and views, your message store provider must implement associated contents tables.
  
To implement associated contents tables, your store provider must do the following:
  
- Support the MAPI_ASSOCIATED flag in the [IMAPIContainer::GetContentsTable](imapicontainer-getcontentstable.md) method so client applications can get the folder's associated contents table instead of the standard contents table. 
    
- Support the MAPI_ASSOCIATED flag in the [IMAPIFolder::CreateMessage](imapifolder-createmessage.md) method so client applications can add messages to a folder's associated contents table. 
    
- Set the MAPI_ACCESS_CREATE_ASSOCIATED bit in the **PR_ACCESS** ( [PidTagAccess](pidtagaccess-canonical-property.md)) property on folder objects.
    
- Support the DEL_ASSOCIATED flag in the [IMAPIFolder::EmptyFolder](imapifolder-emptyfolder.md) method. 
    
- Set the MSGFLAG_ASSOCIATED bit in the **PR_MESSAGE_FLAGS** ( [PidTagMessageFlags](pidtagmessageflags-canonical-property.md)) property for messages in the associated contents table.
    
- Expose and respond to the **PR_FOLDER_ASSOCIATED_CONTENTS** ( [PidTagFolderAssociatedContents](pidtagfolderassociatedcontents-canonical-property.md)) property on folders.
    
- Maintain the **PR_ASSOC_CONTENT_COUNT** ( [PidTagAssociatedContentCount](pidtagassociatedcontentcount-canonical-property.md)) property on folders.
    
There is no bit in the **PR_STORE_SUPPORT_MASK** ( [PidTagStoreSupportMask](pidtagstoresupportmask-canonical-property.md)) property to indicate whether your message store provider supports associated contents tables. If your message store provider does not support them, it should return MAPI_E_NO_SUPPORT when client applications call any of the above methods with the MAPI_ASSOCIATED flag.
