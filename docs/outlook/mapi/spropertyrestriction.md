# SPropertyRestriction

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
Describes a property restriction that is used to match a constant with the value of a property.

```
typedef struct _SPropertyRestriction
{
  ULONG relop;
  ULONG ulPropTag;
  LPSPropValue lpProp;
} SPropertyRestriction;

```

## Members

 **relop**
  
> Relational operator that will be used in the search. Possible values are as follows:
    
RELOP_GE 
  
> The comparison is made based on a greater or equal first value.
    
RELOP_GT 
  
> The comparison is made based on a greater first value.
    
RELOP_LE 
  
> The comparison is made based on a lesser or equal first value.
    
RELOP_LT 
  
> The comparison is made based on a lesser first value.
    
RELOP_NE 
  
> The comparison is made based on unequal values.
    
RELOP_RE 
  
> The comparison is made based on LIKE (regular expression) values.
    
RELOP_EQ 
  
> The comparison is made based on equal values.
    
 **ulPropTag**
  
> Property tag identifying the property to be compared. 
    
 **lpProp**
  
> Pointer to an [SPropValue](spropvalue.md) structure that contains the constant value that will be used in the comparison. 
    
## Remarks

There are two property tags in an **SPropertyRestriction** structure. One is in the **ulPropTag** member and the other is in the **ulPropTag** member of the **SPropValue** structure pointed to by **lpProp**. MAPI requires both the property identifier field and the property type field. The **ulPropTag** in **SPropertyRestriction** is the property to be matched, and the **lpProp** pointer of the **SPropertyRestriction** to the **ulPropTag**'s type of the **SPropValue** indicates how the members value of the **lpProp** union are interpreted. The two property types must match, or else the error value MAPI_E_TOO_COMPLEX is returned when the restriction is used in a call to [IMAPITable::Restrict](imapitable-restrict.md) or [IMAPITable::FindRow](imapitable-findrow.md). 
  
The comparison order is  _(property value) (relational operator) (constant value)_.
  
When a property restriction is passed to **IMAPITable::Restrict** or **IMAPITable::FindRow** and the target property does not exist, the results of the restriction are undefined. By creating an **AND** restriction that joins the property restriction with an **EXIST** restriction, a caller can be guaranteed accurate results. Use an [SExistRestriction](sexistrestriction.md) structure to define the **EXIST** restriction and an [SAndRestriction](sandrestriction.md) structure to define the **AND** restriction. 
  
Multi-valued property tags can be used in property restrictions if the service provider implementing the table supports them. If supported, multi-valued property tags can be used anywhere single-valued property tags can be used. 
  
Multi-valued property tags can be used in the following methods:
  
- [IMAPIProp::SetProps](imapiprop-setprops.md)
    
- [IMAPIProp::GetProps](imapiprop-getprops.md)
    
- [IMAPITable::SetColumns](imapitable-setcolumns.md)
    
- [IMAPITable::SortTable](imapitable-sorttable.md)
    
- [IMAPITable::Restrict](imapitable-restrict.md)
    
> [!IMPORTANT]
> A notable case when the two property tags won't match is if restricting on a multi-value property. In this case the following must be true. > If the property type of the **ulPropTag** of **SPropertyRestriction** contains the multi-value property type bit flag MV_FLAG (0x1000), the property type of the **ulPropTag** of **SPropValue** should match the former minus the MV_FLAG bit flag, that is, its inverse. > For example, to restrict using a multi-value custom string property such as a category with a property tag for the property 0x8012101f, that is, PROP_TAG(MV_FLAG|PT_UNICODE, 0x8012)), the corresponding **SPropertyRestriction** would appear as follows. >  `SPropertyRestriction.ulPropTag = 0x8012101f; // attempt to restrict a MultiValue property`>  `SPropertyRestriction.lpProp->ulPropTag = 0x8012001f; // the lpszW member of the Value property is valid`>  `SPropertyRestriction.lpProp.Value->lpszW = L"My Category";`> Note that if the property type of the **ulPropTag** of **SPropValue** contains the MV_FLAG bit flag, the likely return is MAPI_E_TOO_COMPLEX.
