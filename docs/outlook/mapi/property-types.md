# Property Types

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
MAPI supports both single-value and multiple-value properties. With a single-value property, there is one value of the base type for the property. With a multiple-value property, there are multiple values of the base type. 
  
The single-value and multiple-value property types that MAPI supports are described in the following table. For each single-value type that has a corresponding multiple-value type, the multiple-value type appears in parentheses after the single-value type.
  
|**Property Type**|**Hex Value**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|PT_UNSPECIFIED  <br/> |0000  <br/> |Indicates that the property type is unknown. This property type is reserved for use with interface methods.  <br/> |
|PT_NULL  <br/> |0001  <br/> |Indicates no property value. This property type is reserved for use with interface methods and is the same as the OLE type VT_NULL.  <br/> |
|PT_I2 (PT_MV_I2)  <br/> |0002  <br/> |Signed 16-bit (2-byte) integer. This property type is the same as PT_SHORT (PT_MV_SHORT) and the OLE type VT_I2.  <br/> |
|PT_I4 (PT_MV_I4)  <br/> |0003  <br/> |Signed or unsigned 32-bit (4-byte) integer. This property type is the same as PT_LONG (PT_MV_LONG) and the OLE type VT_I4.  <br/> |
|PT_FLOAT (PT_MV_FLOAT)  <br/> |0004  <br/> |32-bit (8-byte) floating point value. This property type is the same as PT_R4 (PT_MV_R4) and the OLE type VT_R4.  <br/> |
|PT_DOUBLE (PT_MV_DOUBLE)  <br/> |0005  <br/> |64-bit (8-byte) floating point value. This property type is the same as PT_R8 and the OLE types VT_R8 and VT_DOUBLE.  <br/> |
|PT_CURRENCY (PT_MV_CURRENCY )  <br/> |0006  <br/> |64-bit (8-byte) integer interpreted as decimal. This property type is compatible with the Microsoft Visual Basic CURRENCY type and is the same as the OLE type VT_CY.  <br/> |
|PT_APPTIME (PT_MV_APPTIME)  <br/> |0007  <br/> |Double value that is interpreted as date and time. The integer part is the date and the fraction part is the time. This property type is the same as the OLE type VT_DATE and is compatible with the Microsoft Visual Basic time representation.  <br/> |
|PT_ERROR  <br/> |000A  <br/> |SCODE value; 32-bit (4-byte) unsigned integer. This property type is the same as the OLE type VT_ERROR.  <br/> |
|PT_BOOLEAN (PT_MV_12)  <br/> |000B  <br/> |16-bit (2-byte) Boolean value where zero equals **false** and non-zero equals **true**. This property type is the same as the OLE type VT_BOOL.  <br/> |
|PT_OBJECT  <br/> |000D  <br/> |Pointer to an object that implements the **IUnknown** interface. This property type is similar to several OLE types such as VT_UNKNOWN.  <br/> |
|PT_I8 (PT_MV_I8)  <br/> |0014  <br/> |Signed or unsigned 64-bit (8-byte) integer that uses the **LARGE_INTEGER** structure. This property type is the same as PT_I8 and the OLE type VT_I8.  <br/> |
|PT_STRING8 (PT_MV_STRING8)  <br/> |001E  <br/> |Null-terminated 8-bit (2-byte) character string. This property type is the same as the OLE type VT_LPSTR.  <br/> |
|PT_TSTRING (PT_MV_TSTRING)  <br/> |001F  <br/> |Null-terminated 16-bit (2-byte) character string. Properties with this type have the property type reset to PT_UNICODE when compiling with the UNICODE symbol and to PT_STRING8 when not compiling with the UNICODE symbol. This property type is the same as the OLE type VT_LPSTR for resulting PT_STRING8 properties and VT_LPWSTR for PT_UNICODE properties  <br/> |
|PT_SYSTIME (PT_MV_SYSTIME)  <br/> |0040  <br/> |64-bit (8-byte) integer data and time value in the form of a **FILETIME** structure. This property type is the same as the OLE type VT_FILETIME.  <br/> |
|PT_CLSID (PT_MV_CLSID)  <br/> |0048  <br/> |**CLSID** structure value. This property type is the same as the OLE type VT_CLSID.  <br/> |
|PT_SVREID  <br/> |00FB  <br/> |Variable size, a 16-bit (2-byte) **COUNT** followed by a structure.  <br/> |
|PT_SRESTRICT  <br/> |00FD  <br/> |Variable size, a byte array representing one or more Restriction structures.  <br/> |
|PT_ACTIONS  <br/> |00FE  <br/> |Variable size, a 16-bit (2-byte) **COUNT** of actions (not bytes) followed by that many Rule Action structures.  <br/> |
|PT_BINARY (PT_MV_BINARY)  <br/> |0102  <br/> |**SBinary** structure value, a counted byte array.  <br/> |
   
> [!NOTE]
> To determine the Hex value for the multi-valued property type, OR the PT_MV flag (0x00001000) to the Hex value for the property type. For example, the Hex value for PT_MV_UNICODE is 0x101F and the Hex value for PT_MV_BINARY is 0x1102.
