# IAddrBook::GetPAB

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
Returns the entry identifier of the container that is designated as the personal address book (PAB).
  
```cpp
HRESULT GetPAB(
  ULONG FAR * lpcbEntryID,
  LPENTRYID FAR * lppEntryID
);
```

## Parameters

 _lpcbEntryID_
  
> [out] A pointer to the byte count in the entry identifier pointed to by the  _lppEntryID_ parameter. 
    
 _lppEntryID_
  
> [out] A pointer to a pointer to the entry identifier of the PAB. The  _lppEntryID_ parameter contains zero if no container has been designated as the PAB. 
    
## Return value

S_OK 
  
> The entry identifier of the PAB was successfully returned.
    
## Remarks

Clients call the **GetPAB** method to retrieve the entry identifier of the container designated as the PAB. If a PAB has not been established in the profile, MAPI selects as the PAB the first container in the address book hierarchy that allows modifications.
