# Setting a Table Position with a Filter

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
Table users can move the cursor to a row that matches a set of filter criteria. Filters can be based on a variety of guidelines such as column property values, bitmasks, or subobjects. Filters are specified in MAPI using an [SRestriction](srestriction.md) structure. 
  
 **To position a table to the first row that matches the criteria established in a restriction**
  
- Call the [IMAPITable::FindRow](imapitable-findrow.md) method. Starting with the row represented by a particular bookmark, **FindRow** searches in either a forward or backward direction to locate a row that matches the criteria specified in the restriction. **FindRow** can be useful for implementing a scroll bar that is based on character strings, instead of fractional values. For example, a client can call MAPI's implementation of **FindRow** when searching through the integrated address book to enable a user, by entering one or more characters, to locate the first name that begins with the specified characters.
