# Implementing IUnknown in C

**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
Implementations of the [IUnknown::QueryInterface](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms682521%28v=VS.85%29.aspx) method in C are very similar to C++ implementations. There are two basic steps to the implementation: 
  
1. Validating parameters.
    
2. Checking the identifier of the requested interface against the list of interfaces supported by the object and returning either the E_NO_INTERFACE value or a valid interface pointer. If an interface pointer is returned, the implementation should also call the [IUnknown::AddRef](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms691379%28v=VS.85%29.aspx) method to increment the reference count. 
    
The main difference between an implementation of **QueryInterface** in C and C++ is the additional first parameter in the C version. Because the object pointer is added to the parameter list, a C implementation of **QueryInterface** must have more parameter validation than a C++ implementation. The logic for checking the interface identifier, incrementing the reference count, and returning an object pointer should be identical in both languages. 
  
The following code example shows how to implement **QueryInterface** in C for a status object. 
  
```cpp
STDMETHODIMP STATUS_QueryInterface(LPMYSTATUSOBJ lpMyObj, REFIID riid,
                                   LPVOID FAR * lppvObj)
{
    HRESULT hr = hrSuccess;
    // Validate the object pointer.
    if (!lpMyObj || lpMyObj->lpVtbl != &vtblSTATUS )
    {
        hr = ResultFromScode(E_INVALIDARG);
        return hr;
    }
    // Validate other parameters.
    if (!lppvObj)
    {
        hr = ResultFromScode(E_INVALIDARG);
        return hr;
    }
    // Set the output pointer to NULL.
    *lppvObj = NULL;
    // Check the interface identifier.
    if (memcmp(riid, &IID_IUnknown, sizeof(IID)) &&
        memcmp(riid, &IID_IMAPIProp, sizeof(IID)) &&
        memcmp(riid, &IID_IMAPIStatus, sizeof(IID)))
    {
        hr = ResultFromScode(E_NOINTERFACE);
        return hr;
    }
    // The interface is supported. Increment the reference count and return.
    lpMyObj->lpVtbl->AddRef(lpMyObj);
    *lppvObj = lpMyObj;
    return hr;
}

```

Whereas the implementation of the **AddRef** method in C is similar to a C++ implementation, a C implementation of the [IUnknown::Release](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms682317%28v=VS.85%29.aspx) method can get more elaborate than a C++ version. This is because much of the functionality involved with freeing an object can be incorporated into the C++ constructor and destructor, and C has no such mechanism. All of this functionality must be included in the **Release** method. Also, because of the additional parameter and its explicit vtable, more validation is required. 
  
The following **AddRef** method call illustrates a typical C implementation for a status object. 
  
```cpp
STDMETHODIMP_(ULONG) STATUS_AddRef(LPMYSTATUSOBJ lpMyObj)
{
    LONG cRef;
    // Check to see whether it has a lpVtbl object member.
    if (!lpMyObj || lpMyObj->lpVtbl != &vtblSTATUS)
    {
        return 1;
    }
    // Check the method.
    if (STATUS_AddRef != lpMyObj->lpVtbl->AddRef)
    {
        return 1;
    }
    InterlockedIncrement(lpMyObj->cRef);
    cRef = ++lpMyObj->cRef;
    InterlockedDecrement (lpMyObj->cRef);
    return cRef;
}

```

The following code example shows a typical implementation of **Release** for a C status object. If the reference count is 0 after it is decremented, a C status object implementation should perform the following tasks: 
  
- Release any held pointers to objects. 
    
- Set the vtable to NULL, facilitating debugging in the case where an object's user called **Release** yet continued to try to use the object. 
    
- Call **MAPIFreeBuffer** to free the object. 
    
```cpp
STDMETHODIMP_(ULONG) STATUS_Release(LPMYSTATUSOBJ lpMyObj)
{
    LONG cRef;
    // Check the size of the vtable.
    if (!lpMyObj)
    {
        return 1;
    }
    // Check whether the vtable is correct.
    if (lpMyObj->lpVtbl != &vtblSTATUS)
    {
        return 1;
    }
    InterlockedIncrement(lpMyObj->cRef);
    cRef = --lpMyObj->cRef;
    InterlockedIncrement (lpMyObj->cRef);
    if (cRef == 0)
    {
        lpMyObj->lpVtbl->Release(lpMyObj);
        DeleteCriticalSection(&lpMyObj->cs);
        // Release the IMAPIProp pointer.
        lpMyObj->lpProp->Release(lpMyObj->lpProp);
        lpMyObj->lpVtbl = NULL;
        lpMyObj->lpFreeBuff(lpMyObj);
        return 0;
    }
    return cRef;
}

```
