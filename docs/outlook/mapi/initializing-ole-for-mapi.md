# Initializing OLE for MAPI

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
If you also use OLE, call the OLE function [OleInitialize](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms690134%28v=VS.85%29.aspx) to initialize the OLE libraries. **OleInitialize** initializes global data for the session and prepares the OLE libraries to accept calls. For information about calling **OleInitialize**, see the Windows SDK.
