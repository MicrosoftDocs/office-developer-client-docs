# MAPI Properties

 
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
This section contains canonical properties that are supported by Microsoft Outlook Messaging API (MAPI). Each canonical property corresponds to one or multiple related MAPI properties. For more information on canonical properties, see [MAPI Canonical Properties](mapi-canonical-properties.md). For a general explanation of how MAPI works with properties and a list of the properties available for each object, see [MAPI Property Overview](mapi-property-overview.md). For information about the property-related macros, see the reference page for the [SPropValue](spropvalue.md) structure. For a comprehensive list of MAPI properties and their mappings to canonical property names, see [Mapping MAPI Names to Canonical Property Names](mapping-mapi-names-to-canonical-property-names.md) and [Mapping Canonical Property Names to MAPI Names](mapping-canonical-property-names-to-mapi-names.md). 
  
Note: Unlike members of OLE variant arrays, every member in a MAPI multivalued property array is of the same type.
