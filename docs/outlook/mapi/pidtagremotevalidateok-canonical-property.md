|Associated properties:  <br/> |PR_REMOTE_VALIDATE_OK  <br/> |

|Data type:  <br/> |PT_BOOLEAN  <br/> |
|Area:  <br/> |MAPI Status  <br/> |
   
## Remarks

This property appears in the status table and offers some control over transport performance. It can be considered as another way of directing the remote viewer to idle. When it is set to TRUE, the remote viewer can call **IMAPIStatus::ValidateState** as often as desired. A value of FALSE indicates that the remote viewer cannot make any more calls. 
  
The transport provider usually sets this property dynamically, by setting the value to FALSE to disable additional calls when the transport provider has a sufficient amount of processing to perform. When the transport provider is done, it then sets the value to TRUE to allow the client application to make further **IMAPIStatus::ValidateState** calls.
