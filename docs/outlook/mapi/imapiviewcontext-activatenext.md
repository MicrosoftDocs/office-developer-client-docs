# IMAPIViewContext::ActivateNext

**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
Activates the next or previous message in the view order. 
  
```cpp
HRESULT ActivateNext(
ULONG ulDir,
LPCRECT prcPosRect
);
```

## Parameters

_ulDir_
  
> [in] Status flags giving information about the message to be activated. Valid flag settings are:
    
  - VCDIR_CATEGORY: The viewer should activate a message in another category of the view. The message to be activated is: 
        
    - The first message in the next view category if this flag is **OR**ed with VCDIR_NEXT. 
        
    - The last message in the previous view category if this flag is **OR**ed with VCDIR_PREV and the previous category is expanded. 
        
    - The first message in the previous view category if this flag is **OR**ed with VCDIR_PREV and the previous category is not expanded. In this case the previous category undergoes automatic expansion. 
        
  - VCDIR_DELETE: The viewer should activate the next or previous message because the current message has been deleted. 
        
  - VCDIR_MOVE: The viewer should activate the next or previous message because the current message has been moved. 
        
  - VCDIR_NEXT: The viewer should activate the next message in the view order. 
        
  - VCDIR_PREV: The viewer should activate the previous message in the view order. 
        
  - VCDIR_UNREAD: The viewer should activate the next or previous unread message in the view order. 
    
_prcPosRect_
  
> [in] Pointer to a Windows **RECT** structure containing the size and position of the window to be used to display the activated message. 
    
## Return value

S_OK 
  
> The message was activated successfully. 
    
S_FALSE 
  
> The message was activated successfully, but a different type of form was opened in the process.
    
## Remarks

Form objects call the **IMAPIViewContext::ActivateNext** method to change what message is displayed to the user. The value passed in the  _ulDir_ parameter indicates which message should be activated and, in some cases, why. The VCDIR_NEXT and VCDIR_PREVIOUS flags correspond to users choosing the **Next** or **Previous** command in a view, respectively. These operations usually correspond to moving up or down one message in the form viewer's list of messages. 
  
The VCDIR_DELETE and VCDIR_MOVE flags are set by the [IMAPIMessageSite::DeleteMessage](imapimessagesite-deletemessage.md) and [IMAPIMessageSite::MoveMessage](imapimessagesite-movemessage.md) methods, respectively. Implementations of these methods call **ActivateNext** with the appropriate direction and then perform the requested operation on the message if the **ActivateNext** call did not fail. Form viewers typically enable users to specify the direction to move in the message list. 
  
## Notes to implementers

Your implementation of [IMAPIViewContext::ActivateNext](imapiviewcontext-activatenext.md) makes the next or previous message in the folder, depending on the value of  _ulDir_, the current message. After **ActivateNext** returns, call [IMAPIMessageSite::GetMessage](imapimessagesite-getmessage.md) to get a pointer to the newly activated message. 
  
## Notes to callers

If **ActivateNext** returns S_FALSE, or if a current message is not present, perform your normal shutdown procedure which should include calling your form's [IMAPIForm::ShutdownForm](imapiform-shutdownform.md) method. If a next or previous message is displayed, use the window rectangle passed in the  _prcPosRect_ parameter to display it.
