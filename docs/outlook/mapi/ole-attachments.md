# OLE Attachments

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
Attachments that are OLE objects are encoded as OLE 1 stream objects for backward compatibility. If the original object is really an OLE 2 **IStorage** object, then the object must be converted to an OLE 1 stream. This conversion is performed using the **OleConvertIStorageToOLESTREAM** function, which is part of the Win32 OLE libraries.
