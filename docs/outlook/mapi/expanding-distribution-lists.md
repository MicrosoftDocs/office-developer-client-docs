# Expanding Distribution Lists

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
 **To prompt MAPI to expand a distribution list**
  
- Set its **PR_ADDRTYPE** ([PidTagAddressType](pidtagaddresstype-canonical-property.md)) property to MAPIPDL.
    
    MAPI expands addresses with this type before sending the message to the transport provider.
