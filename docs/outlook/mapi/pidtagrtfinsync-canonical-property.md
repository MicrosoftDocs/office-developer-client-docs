# PidTagRtfInSync Canonical Property

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
Contains TRUE if the **PR_RTF_COMPRESSED** ([PidTagRtfCompressed](pidtagrtfcompressed-canonical-property.md)) property has the same text content as the **PR_BODY** ([PidTagBody](pidtagbody-canonical-property.md)) property for this message.

|Data type:  <br/> |PT_BOOLEAN  <br/> |
|Area:  <br/> |Email  <br/> |
   
## Remarks

A value of TRUE means that the **PR_BODY** ([PidTagBody](pidtagbody-canonical-property.md)) property, the plain text version of this message, and the **PR_RTF_COMPRESSED** ([PidTagRtfCompressed](pidtagrtfcompressed-canonical-property.md)) property, the Rich Text Format (RTF) version, are identical except for white space in **PR_BODY** and formatting in **PR_RTF_COMPRESSED**. The text in the two versions consists of the same characters in the same sequence.
  
A value of FALSE means that the two versions are not synchronized for text content but are capable of being synchronized by the [RTFSync](rtfsync.md) function. One version has been altered and the other version has not. 
  
No value means that the two versions, if both exist or ever existed, cannot be synchronized. One version has been deleted or altered so radically that synchronization is no longer possible.
  
A client application that has modified **PR_RTF_COMPRESSED** should set a value of FALSE in this property to force synchronization. RTF-aware message stores should perform the synchronization using **RTFSync** during an [IMAPIProp::SaveChanges](imapiprop-savechanges.md) call. RTF-aware clients should check the setting of **PR_RTF_IN_SYNC** before reading **PR_RTF_COMPRESSED**, and call **RTFSync** first if necessary. 
  
If **PR_BODY** has had modifications to anything other than its white space, the message store must delete **PR_RTF_IN_SYNC** to terminate synchronization.
