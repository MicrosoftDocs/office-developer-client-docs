# Verify an attachment is blocked

**Applies to**: Outlook 2013 | Outlook 2016 
  
This code sample in C++ shows how to use the [IAttachmentSecurity : IUnknown](iattachmentsecurityiunknown.md) interface to find out whether an attachment is blocked by Microsoft Outlook 2010 or Microsoft Outlook 2013 for viewing and indexing. 
  
[IAttachmentSecurity : IUnknown](iattachmentsecurityiunknown.md) is derived from the [IUnknown](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms680509%28VS.85%29.aspx) interface. You can obtain the [IAttachmentSecurity : IUnknown](iattachmentsecurityiunknown.md) interface by calling [IUnknown::QueryInterface](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms682521%28v=VS.85%29.aspx) on the MAPI session object, requesting **IID_IAttachmentSecurity**. [IAttachmentSecurity::IsAttachmentBlocked](iattachmentsecurity-isattachmentblocked.md) returns **true** in  _pfBlocked_ if the attachment is considered unsafe by Outlook 2010 or Outlook 2013 and is blocked for viewing and indexing in Outlook 2010 or Outlook 2013. 
  
```cpp
HRESULT IsAttachmentBlocked(LPMAPISESSION lpMAPISession, LPCWSTR pwszFileName, BOOL* pfBlocked) 
{ 
    if (!lpMAPISession || !pwszFileName || !pfBlocked) return MAPI_E_INVALID_PARAMETER; 
 
    HRESULT hRes = S_OK; 
    IAttachmentSecurity* lpAttachSec = NULL; 
    BOOL bBlocked = false; 
 
    hRes = lpMAPISession-&gt;QueryInterface(IID_IAttachmentSecurity,(void**)&amp;lpAttachSec); 
    if (SUCCEEDED(hRes) &amp;&amp; lpAttachSec) 
    { 
        hRes = lpAttachSec-&gt;IsAttachmentBlocked(pwszFileName,&amp;bBlocked); 
    } 
    if (lpAttachSec) lpAttachSec-&gt;Release(); 
 
    *pfBlocked = bBlocked; 
    return hRes; 
}

```
