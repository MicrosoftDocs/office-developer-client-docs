If the function fails, the return value is zero. To get extended error information, call the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) function, **[GetLastError](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms679360.aspx)**. 
  
## Remarks

 **FixMAPI** does not replace the current mapi32.dll file if the file is marked as read-only. 
  
 **FixMAPI** does not replace the current mapi32.dll if Microsoft Exchange Server is installed on the computer. 
  
When **FixMAPI** makes a backup copy of the current copy of mapi32.dll on the computer, it assigns the backup copy a name different from "mapi32.dll". It then directs subsequent calls intended for that assembly to the backup copy.
