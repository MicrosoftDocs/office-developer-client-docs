# PreprocessMessage

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
Defines a function that preprocesses message contents or the format of a message.
  
|||
|:-----|:-----|
|Header file:  <br/> |Mapispi.h  <br/> |
|Defined function implemented by:  <br/> |Transport providers  <br/> |
|Defined function called by:  <br/> |MAPI spooler  <br/> |
   
```cpp
HRESULT PreprocessMessage(
  LPVOID lpvSession,
  LPMESSAGE lpMessage,
  LPADRBOOK lpAdrBook,
  LPMAPIFOLDER lpFolder,
  LPALLOCATEBUFFER AllocateBuffer,
  LPALLOCATEMORE AllocateMore,
  LPFREEBUFFER FreeBuffer,
  ULONG FAR * lpcOutbound,
  LPMESSAGE FAR * FAR * lpppMessage,
  LPADRLIST FAR * lppRecipList
);
```

## Parameters

 _lpvSession_
  
> [in] Pointer to the session to be used. 
    
 _lpMessage_
  
> [in] Pointer to the message to be preprocessed. 
    
 _lpAdrBook_
  
> [in] Pointer to the address book from which the user should select recipients for the message. 
    
 _lpFolder_
  
> [in, out] Pointer to a folder. On input, the  _lpFolder_ parameter points to the folder that contains messages to be preprocessed. On output,  _lpFolder_ points to the folder where preprocessed messages have been placed. 
    
 _lpAllocateBuffer_
  
> [in] Pointer to the [MAPIAllocateBuffer](mapiallocatebuffer.md) function, to be used to allocate memory. 
    
 _lpAllocateMore_
  
> [in] Pointer to the [MAPIAllocateMore](mapiallocatemore.md) function, to be used to allocate additional memory where required. 
    
 _lpFreeBuffer_
  
> [in] Pointer to the [MAPIFreeBuffer](mapifreebuffer.md) function, to be used to free memory. 
    
 _lpcOutbound_
  
> [out] Pointer to the number of messages in the array pointed to by the  _lpppMessage_ parameter. 
    
 _lpppMessage_
  
> [out] Pointer to a pointer to an array of pointers to preprocessed or otherwise generated messages. 
    
 _lppRecipList_
  
> [out] Pointer to an optional returned [ADRLIST](adrlist.md) structure, listing preprocessor-detected recipients for which the message is undeliverable. For more information about the contents of this list, see the [IMAPISupport::StatusRecips](imapisupport-statusrecips.md) method. 
    
## Return value

S_OK
  
> Message contents were successfully preprocessed.
    
## Remarks

A transport-provider message preprocessor can present a progress indicator during message preprocessing. However, it should never present a dialog box requiring user interaction during message preprocessing. 
  
When a preprocessor adds large amounts of data to an outbound message, certain procedures should be followed. This type of message can be stored in a server-based message store, causing the preprocessor to access a remote store, a time-consuming procedure. To avoid having to do so, the preprocessor should have an option that enables it to store data that takes a large amount of space in a local message store and to provide a reference to that local store in the message. 
  
The preprocessor should not release any of the objects originally passed to the **PreprocessMessage** based function. 
  
Before the MAPI spooler can call a **PreprocessMessage** function, the transport provider must have registered the function in a call to the [IMAPISupport::RegisterPreprocessor](imapisupport-registerpreprocessor.md) method. After calling a **PreprocessMessage** function, the spooler cannot continue submitting a message until the function returns. 
  
The MAPI spooler owns the task of submitting messages. This means the original message is never placed in an array of message pointers and that a call to the **SubmitMessage** methods is never required.
