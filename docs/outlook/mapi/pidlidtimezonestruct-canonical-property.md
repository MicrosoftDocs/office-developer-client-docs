# PidLidTimeZoneStruct Canonical Property

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
Contains a stream that maps to the persisted format of a [TZREG](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb820983%28v=office.12%29.aspx) structure, which describes the time zone to be used for the start and end time of a recurring appointment or meeting request.

|Property set:  <br/> |PSETID_Appointment  <br/> |
|Long ID (LID):  <br/> |0x00008233  <br/> |
|Data type:  <br/> |PT_BINARY  <br/> |
|Area:  <br/> |Calendar  <br/> |
   
## Remarks

Microsoft Office Outlook 2003, earlier versions of Outlook, and applications that are based on Collaboration Data Objects (CDO) 1.21 whose users have not run the calendar update tool provided by Outlook or Exchange Server store the start time and end time of a recurring appointment or meeting request as relative time, and store the time zone where the appointment or meeting request is created in **dispidTimeZoneStruct**. However, this scheme ignores that over time, time zone rules can change, resulting in some appointments and meetings that users scheduled before the rules changed and occur at incorrect times. Users and administrators who are not running Windows Vista or who do not have automatic updates turned on should use the calendar rebasing tools that are provided by Outlook or Exchange Server to adjust the time of such appointments and meeting requests. For more information about these calendar rebasing tools and APIs that rebase calendars, see [About rebasing calendars programmatically for Daylight Saving Time](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/38b342d9-ab10-04b6-5490-9a45f847a60f%28Office.15%29.aspx)
  
Use the following little-endian format when parsing a stream obtained from **dispidTimeZoneStruct**, or when persisting the **TZREG** structure to a stream to commit to the **dispidTimeZoneStruct** binary property. 
  
```
long        lBias;           // offset from GMT
long        lStandardBias;   // offset from bias during standard time
long        lDaylightBias;   // offset from bias during daylight time
WORD        wStandardYear;      // matches the stStandardDate's wYear member
SYSTEMTIME  stStandardDate;  // time to switch to standard time
WORD        wDaylightYear;      // matches the stDaylightDate's wYear field
SYSTEMTIME  stDaylightDate;  // time to switch to daylight time
```

This property is set on a recurring series to specify time-zone information, and specifies how to convert time fields between local time and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
