# MapiSvc.inf [Help File Mappings] Section

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
The **[Help File Mappings]** section contains entries that each map one message service to the file that provides Help for errors generated by the service. Entries in this section use the following format: 
  
 **[Help File Mappings]** _message service name_ =  _Help file name_
  
The message service name is the name of the installed message service; the Help file name is the name of the file where the error information resides. The example following shows a typical **[Help File Mappings]** section that contains entries for three services: MAPI, the MsgService service, and the MS service. 
  
```cpp
[Help File Mappings]
MAPI=MAPI.HLP
MsgService=MYHELP.HLP
MS=STORE.HLP

```
