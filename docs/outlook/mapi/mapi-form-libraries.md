# MAPI Form Libraries

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
To help organize form servers and make them easily available to client applications, the MAPI form architecture includes form libraries, which support the installation, administration, replication, and use of form servers.
  
Form libraries are repositories of form servers and configuration information about them that the form manager uses when loading form servers. 
  
> [!NOTE]
> Early in the history of MAPI, form libraries were called "registries." Because of this, the term "registry" has persisted in some form-related MAPI interfaces, properties, configuration file entries, and so forth. If your application's interface requires use of one of these terms, you should use the term "library" exclusively.
