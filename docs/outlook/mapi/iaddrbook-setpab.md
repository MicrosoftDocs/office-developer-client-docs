# IAddrBook::SetPAB

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
Designates a particular container as the personal address book (PAB).
  
```cpp
HRESULT SetPAB(
  ULONG cbEntryID,
  LPENTRYID lpEntryID
);
```

## Parameters

 _cbEntryID_
  
> [in] The byte count in the entry identifier pointed to by the  _lpEntryID_ parameter. 
    
 _lpEntryID_
  
> [in] A pointer to the entry identifier of the container to be designated as the PAB. The  _lpEntryID_ parameter cannot be NULL. 
    
## Return value

S_OK 
  
> The specified container has been established as the PAB.
    
## Remarks

Clients and service providers call the **SetPAB** method to designate a particular container as the PAB. The PAB is a container that consists of entries copied from other containers as well as new entries. 
  
A call to **SetPAB** establishes a container as the PAB until that container is made unavailable or a new container becomes the PAB through a subsequent call to **SetPAB**. 
  
Clients and providers do not have to call the [IMAPIProp::SaveChanges](imapiprop-savechanges.md) method to make the PAB change permanent.
