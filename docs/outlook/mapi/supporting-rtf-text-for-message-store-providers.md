# Supporting RTF Text for Message Store Providers

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
Some client applications allow users to use Rich Text Format (RTF) text in their messages. If your message store provider needs to support RTF text in messages, it needs to handle the **PR_RTF_COMPRESSED** ([PidTagRtfCompressed](pidtagrtfcompressed-canonical-property.md)) property, in addition to the **PR_BODY** ([PidTagBody](pidtagbody-canonical-property.md)) property. Primarily, this means storing both properties, and making sure that **PR_BODY** contains a plain text version of the text in **PR_RTF_COMPRESSED**. The [RTFSync](rtfsync.md) function is useful for this purpose. 
  
There are two flags that can be set in the message store object's **PR_STORE_SUPPORT_MASK** ([PidTagStoreSupportMask](pidtagstoresupportmask-canonical-property.md)) property that tell clients what they can expect from the message store provider with respect to the **PR_BODY** and **PR_RTF_COMPRESSED** properties on messages in the message store. The STORE_RTF_OK flag indicates that the store can generate the value of the **PR_BODY** property from the **PR_RTF_COMPRESSED** property dynamically, which relieves clients from the burden of synchronizing them explicitly. The STORE_UNCOMPRESSED_RTF flag indicates that the message store provider can support uncompressed data in **PR_RTF_COMPRESSED**.
  
Message store providers that do not support RTF text need to delete the **PR_RTF_IN_SYNC** ([PidTagRtfInSync](pidtagrtfinsync-canonical-property.md)) property when the **PR_BODY** property changes in order to interoperate properly with client applications that do support RTF text.
