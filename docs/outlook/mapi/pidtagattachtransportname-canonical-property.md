# PidTagAttachTransportName Canonical Property

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
Contains the name of an attachment file modified so that it can be associated with TNEF messages. 
  
|||
|:-----|:-----|
|Associated properties:  <br/> |PR_ATTACH_TRANSPORT_NAME, PR_ATTACH_TRANSPORT_NAME_A, PR_ATTACH_TRANSPORT_NAME_W  <br/> |
|Identifier:  <br/> |0x370C  <br/> |
|Data type:  <br/> |PT_STRING8, PT_UNICODE  <br/> |
|Area:  <br/> |Message attachment  <br/> |
   
## Remarks

TNEF and the transport provider use these properties. They are usually not available to client applications. 
  
These properties are commonly used by TNEF when the underlying messaging system does not support the supplied filenames. For example, they are used when the user attaches multiple files with the same name, such as five files named CONFIG.SYS. The transport provider must modify the names to make sure they are unique. Each modified name appears in its attachment's **PR_ATTACH_TRANSPORT_NAME** and associated properties.
