## Members

**ulEventType**
  
> Type of notification event that occurred. The value of the **ulEventType** member corresponds to the structure that is included in the **info** union. The **ulEventType** member can be set to one of the following values: 
    
 _fnevCriticalError_
  
> A global error has occurred, such as a session shut down in progress. The **info** member contains an [ERROR_NOTIFICATION](error_notification.md) structure. 
    
 _fnevExtended_
  
> An internal event defined by a particular service provider has occurred. The **info** member contains an [EXTENDED_NOTIFICATION](extended_notification.md) structure. 
    
 _fnevNewMail_
  
> A message has been delivered to the appropriate receive folder for the message class and is waiting to be processed. The **info** member contains an [NEWMAIL_NOTIFICATION](newmail_notification.md) structure. 
    
 _fnevObjectCopied_
  
> A MAPI object has been copied. The **info** member contains an [OBJECT_NOTIFICATION](object_notification.md) structure. 
    
 _fnevObjectCreated_
  
> A MAPI object has been created. The **info** member contains an **OBJECT_NOTIFICATION** structure. 
    
 _fnevObjectDeleted_
  
> A MAPI object has been deleted. The **info** member contains an **OBJECT_NOTIFICATION** structure. 
    
 _fnevObjectModified_
  
> A MAPI object has changed. The **info** member contains an **OBJECT_NOTIFICATION** structure.

> A message store or address book object has been moved. The **info** member contains an **OBJECT_NOTIFICATION** structure. 
    
 _fnevSearchComplete_
  
> A search operation has finished and the results are available. The **info** member contains an **OBJECT_NOTIFICATION** structure. 
    
 _fnevTableModified_
  
> Information in a table has changed. The **info** member contains an [TABLE_NOTIFICATION](table_notification.md) structure. 
    
**info**
  
> Union of notification structures describing the affected data for a particular type of event. The structure included in the **info** member depends on the value of the **ulEventType** member. 
    
## Remarks

One or more **NOTIFICATION** structures are passed as input parameters with every call to a registered advise sink's [IMAPIAdviseSink::OnNotify](imapiadvisesink-onnotify.md) method. The **NOTIFICATION** structures contain information about the particular events that have occurred and describe the affected objects. 
  
Before clients or service providers receiving a notification can use the structure to process the event, they must check the event type as indicated in the **ulEventType** member. For example, the code sample that is shown here checks for the arrival of a new message and upon detecting an event of this kind, prints out the message class of the message. 
  
```cpp
if (pNotif -> ulEventType == fnevNewMail)
{
printf("%s\n", pNotif -> newmail.lpszMessageClass)
}

```
