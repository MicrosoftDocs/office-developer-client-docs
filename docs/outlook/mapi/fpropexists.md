```cpp
BOOL FPropExists(
  LPMAPIPROP pobj,
  ULONG ulPropTag
);
```

## Parameters

 _pobj_
  
> [in] Pointer to the **IMAPIProp** interface or interface derived from **IMAPIProp** within which to search for the property tag. 
    
 _ulPropTag_
  
> [in] Property tag for which to search.
    
## Return value

TRUE 
  
> A match for the given property tag was found. 
    
FALSE 
  
> A match for the given property tag was not found.
    
## Remarks

If the property tag in the  _ulPropTag_ parameter has type PT_UNSPECIFIED, the **FPropExists** function looks for a match based only on the property identifier. Otherwise, the match is for the entire property tag, including the type.
