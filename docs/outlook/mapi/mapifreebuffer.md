# MAPIFreeBuffer

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
Frees a memory buffer allocated with a call to the [MAPIAllocateBuffer](mapiallocatebuffer.md) function or the [MAPIAllocateMore](mapiallocatemore.md) function.

|:-----|:-----|
|Header file:  <br/> |Mapix.h  <br/> |
|Implemented by:  <br/> |MAPI  <br/> |
|Called by:  <br/> |Client applications and service providers  <br/> |
   
```cpp
ULONG MAPIFreeBuffer(
  LPVOID lpBuffer
);
```

## Parameters

 _lpBuffer_
  
> [in] Pointer to a previously allocated memory buffer. If NULL is passed in the  _lpBuffer_ parameter, **MAPIFreeBuffer** does nothing. 
    
## Return value

S_OK 
  
> The call succeeded and freed the memory requested. **MAPIFreeBuffer** can also return S_OK on already freed locations or if memory block is not allocated with **MAPIAllocateBuffer** and **MAPIAllocateMore**.
    
## Remarks

Usually, when a client application or service provider calls [MAPIAllocateBuffer](mapiallocatebuffer.md) or [MAPIAllocateMore](mapiallocatemore.md), the operating system constructs in one contiguous memory buffer one or more complex structures with multiple levels of pointers. When a MAPI function or method creates a buffer with such contents, a client can later free all the structures contained in the buffer by passing to **MAPIFreeBuffer** the pointer to the buffer returned by the MAPI function that created the buffer. For a service provider to free a memory buffer using **MAPIFreeBuffer**, it must pass the pointer to that buffer returned with the provider's support object. 
  
The call to **MAPIFreeBuffer** to free a particular buffer must be made as soon as a client or provider is finished using this buffer. Simply calling the [IMAPISession::Logoff](imapisession-logoff.md) method at the end of a MAPI session does not automatically release memory buffers. 
  
A client or service provider should operate on the assumption that the pointer passed in  _lpBuffer_ is invalid after a successful return from **MAPIFreeBuffer**. If the pointer indicates either a memory block not allocated by the messaging system through **MAPIAllocateBuffer** or **MAPIAllocateMore** or a free memory block, the behavior of **MAPIFreeBuffer** is undefined. 
  
> [!NOTE]
> Passing a null pointer to **MAPIFreeBuffer** makes application cleanup code simpler and smaller because **MAPIFreeBuffer** can initialize pointers to NULL and then free them in the cleanup code without having to test them first.
