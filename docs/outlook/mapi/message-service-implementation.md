# Message Service Implementation

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
A message service is one or more related service providers grouped together for the purpose of simplifying installation and configuration. All service providers should be included in a message service.
  
To implement a message service with one or more providers, use the following procedure:
  
1. Design the message service, determining the number and type of service providers to be included. For more information about how to design a message service, see [Designing a Message Service](designing-a-message-service.md).
    
2. Create a setup program to install the service providers in the message service. For more information about writing a message service setup program, see [Supporting Message Service Installation](supporting-message-service-installation.md). 
    
3. Create an entry point function to perform configuration. For more information about writing a message service entry point function, see [Supporting Message Service Configuration](supporting-message-service-configuration.md) and [MSGSERVICEENTRY](msgserviceentry.md). 
    
4. Create a public header file that contains the property tags and descriptions of valid values for any custom properties that the message service supports.
