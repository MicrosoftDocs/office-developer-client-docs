# Invalidating an Object

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
As part of your provider's shutdown process, you might want to invalidate an object. Invalidating an object involves replacing its vtable with a vtable that contains implementations for the three **IUnknown** methods: **AddRef**, **Release**, and **QueryInterface**. Invalidate an object by calling [IMAPISupport::MakeInvalid](imapisupport-makeinvalid.md), a method that is included in the support object of each of the three common provider types. Providers typically make this call in the implementation of their logon object's **Logoff** method. 
  
Invalidating an object gives MAPI the ultimate responsibility for freeing the memory associated with an object. You can free all of the resources connected with an object and then call **MakeInvalid** to invalidate all of the methods in its inherited interfaces. Calls to any of these methods will return MAPI_E_INVALID_OBJECT. Using **MakeInvalid** is an option that many service providers choose to ignore.
