# Custom Processing with TNEF

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
Transport providers can use custom processing to process the properties on an attachment itself, transmit attachments separately, or transmit them through the messaging system's attachment model. TNEF uses a mechanism that enables the transport provider to send the attachments apart from the message and reconnect them on the receiving side.
