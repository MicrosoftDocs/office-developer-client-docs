# Implementing a sample object

**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
Advise sink objects — objects that support the [IMAPIAdviseSink : IUnknown](imapiadvisesinkiunknown.md) interface — are MAPI objects that client applications implement for processing notifications. **IMAPIAdviseSink** inherits directly from [IUnknown](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms680509%28v=VS.85%29.aspx) and contains only one method, **OnNotify**. Therefore, to implement an advise sink object, a client creates code for the three methods in **IUnknown** and for [OnNotify](imapiadvisesink-onnotify.md).
  
The Mapidefs.h header file defines an **IMAPIAdviseSink** interface implementation by using **DECLARE_MAPI_INTERFACE**, as follows:
  
```cpp
#define      INTERFACE  IMAPIAdviseSink
DECLARE_MAPI_INTERFACE_(IMAPIAdviseSink, IUnknown)
{
    BEGIN_INTERFACE
    MAPI_IUNKNOWN_METHODS(PURE)
    MAPI_IMAPIADVISESINK_METHODS(PURE)
};
 
```

Clients that implement advise sink objects can define their interfaces in their objects manually or with the **MAPI_IUNKNOWN_METHODS** and **MAPI_IMAPIADVISESINK_METHODS** macros. Object implementers should use the interface macros whenever possible to ensure consistency across objects and to save time and effort. 
  
Implementing the [IUnknown::AddRef](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms691379%28v=VS.85%29.aspx) and [IUnknown::Release](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms682317%28v=VS.85%29.aspx) methods is relatively simple because typically only a few lines of code are needed. Therefore, clients and service providers that implement objects can make their **AddRef** and **Release** implementations inline. The following code shows how to define a C++ advise sink object with inline implementations of **AddRef** and **Release**.
  
```cpp
class  CMAPIAdviseSink : public IMAPIAdviseSink
{
public:
    STDMETHODIMP QueryInterface
                    (REFIID                     riid,
                     LPVOID *                   ppvObj);
    inline STDMETHODIMP_(ULONG) AddRef
                    () { InterlockedIncrement(m_cRef);
                         ++m_cRef;
                         InterlockedDecrement(m_cRef);
                         return m_cRef; };
    inline STDMETHODIMP_(ULONG) Release
                    () { InterlockedIncrement(m_cRef);
                         ULONG ulCount = --m_cRef;
                         InterlockedDecrement(m_cRef);
                         if (!ulCount)  delete this;
                         return ulCount;};
    MAPI_IMAPIADVISESINK_METHODS(IMPL);
    BOOL WINAPI AddConnection (LPMDB pMDBObj, ULONG ulConnection);
    void WINAPI RemoveAllLinks (LPMDB pMDBObj);
// Constructors and destructors.
public :
    inline CMAPIAdviseSink  (CStoreClient * pStore)
                            { m_cRef = 1;
                              m_ulConnection = 0;
                              m_pStore = pStore;
                              AddRef;};
    ~CMAPIAdviseSink () {Release};
private :
    ULONG               m_cRef;
    CStoreClient *      m_pStore;
    ULONG               m_ulConnection;
};
 
```

In C, the advise sink object is composed of the following elements:
  
- A pointer to a vtable that contains pointers to implementations of each of the methods in **IUnknown** and **IMAPIAdviseSink**.
    
- Data members.
    
The following code example shows how to define an advise sink object in C and construct its vtable. 
  
```cpp
// Object definition.
typedef struct _ADVISESINK
{
    const ADVISE_Vtbl FAR *    lpVtbl;
    ULONG             cRef;
    STORECLIENT      *pStore;
    ULONG             ulConnection;
} ADVISESINK, *LPADVISESINK;
// vtable definition.
static const ADVISE_Vtbl vtblADVISE =
{
    ADVISE_QueryInterface,
    ADVISE_AddRef,
    ADVISE_Release,
    ADVISE_OnNotify
};
 
```

After you declare an object in C, you must initialize it by setting the vtable pointer to the address of the constructed vtable, as shown in the following code:
  
```cpp
LPADVISESINK lpMyObj = NULL;
HRESULT hr = (*lpAllocateBuffer) (sizeof(ADVISESINK),
                 (LPVOID *)&lpMyObj);
lpMyObj->lpVtbl = &vtblADVISE;
 
```
