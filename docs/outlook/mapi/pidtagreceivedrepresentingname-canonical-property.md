# PidTagReceivedRepresentingName Canonical Property

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
Contains the display name for the messaging user who is represented by the receiving user.
  
|||
|:-----|:-----|
|Associated properties:  <br/> |PR_RCVD_REPRESENTING_NAME, PR_RCVD_REPRESENTING_NAME_A, PR_RCVD_REPRESENTING_NAME_W  <br/> |
|Identifier:  <br/> |0x0044  <br/> |
|Data type:  <br/> |PT_UNICODE, PT_STRING8  <br/> |
|Area:  <br/> |Address  <br/> |
   
## Remarks

These properties are examples of the address properties for the messaging user who is being represented by the receiving user. They must be set by the incoming transport provider, which is also responsible for authorization or verification of the delegate. If no messaging user is being represented, these properties should be set to the display name contained in the **PR_RECEIVED_BY_NAME** ([PidTagReceivedByName](pidtagreceivedbyname-canonical-property.md)) property.
  
A client application replying to a message received on behalf of another client should copy these properties from the received message into the **PR_SENT_REPRESENTING_NAME** ([PidTagSentRepresentingName](pidtagsentrepresentingname-canonical-property.md)) property for the reply.
