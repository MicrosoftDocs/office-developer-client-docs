## Remarks

This property is computed by all service providers. It contains a [MAPIUID](mapiuid.md) structure associated with, and usually hard-coded by, the provider. It is typically used by a client application that is interested in only the address book containers supplied by a particular provider. 
  
This property appears only as a column entry in the provider table.
