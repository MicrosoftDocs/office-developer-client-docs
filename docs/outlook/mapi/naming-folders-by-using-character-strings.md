# Naming Folders by Using Character Strings

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
If you access one or more folders frequently during a session, consider assigning names to the folders with the [IMsgStore::SetReceiveFolder](imsgstore-setreceivefolder.md) method. Although **IMsgStore::SetReceiveFolder** is used primarily to establish special folders to receive incoming messages for particular message classes, it can also be used to associate any folder with a name. The name can be the same as the message class or it can be any character string, customized for your client's use. Associating a name with a folder decreases the time it takes to find and open the folder.
