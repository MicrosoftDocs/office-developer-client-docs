# IMAPIProgress : IUnknown

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
Implements a progress object that provides client applications with a progress indicator. A progress indicator is a user-interface display that shows the percentage of completion of an operation, such as copying folders between message stores. MAPI and client applications implement progress objects and service providers use them.

## Vtable Order

|||
|:-----|:-----|
|[Progress](imapiprogress-progress.md) <br/> |Updates the progress indicator with a display of the progress as it is made toward completion of the operation.  <br/> |
|[GetFlags](imapiprogress-getflags.md) <br/> |Returns flag settings from the progress object for the level of operation on which progress information is calculated.  <br/> |
|[GetMax](imapiprogress-getmax.md) <br/> |Returns the maximum number of items in the operation for which progress information is displayed.  <br/> |
|[GetMin](imapiprogress-getmin.md) <br/> |Returns the minimum value in the [SetLimits](imapiprogress-setlimits.md) method for which progress information is displayed.  <br/> |
|[SetLimits](imapiprogress-setlimits.md) <br/> |Sets the lower and upper limits for the number of items in the operation, and the flags that control how progress information is calculated for the operation.  <br/> |
   
## Remarks

MAPI includes an  _lpProgress_ parameter in many of the methods that perform potentially lengthy operations.  _lpProgress_ points to a client implementation of a progress object. Clients that implement the **IMAPIProgress** interface set this parameter to point to their implementation; clients that do not implement **IMAPIProgress** set the parameter to NULL. To display a progress indicator during processing of the operation, service providers use the progress object supplied by the client, if available, or a MAPI implementation (indicated when  _lpProgress_ is set to NULL).
