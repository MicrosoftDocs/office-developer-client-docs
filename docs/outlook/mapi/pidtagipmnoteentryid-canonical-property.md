## Remarks

This property is stored in the Inbox folder as well as the root folder of the message store. To access the property on a specific message store, do the following: 
  
1. First, look for the property in the Inbox folder. Use [IMsgStore::GetReceiveFolder](imsgstore-getreceivefolder.md) to obtain a reference to the **EntryID** for the Inbox folder. 
    
2. If ** IMsgStore::GetReceiveFolder ** is successful, then use the reference to the **EntryID** of the Inbox and [IMsgStore::OpenEntry](imsgstore-openentry.md) to open the Inbox and obtain a reference to an **IMAPIFolder** object. 
    
3. If **IMsgStore::OpenEntry** is successful, then use the returned reference to the **IMAPIFolder** object and [IMAPIProp::GetProps](imapiprop-getprops.md) to obtain the desired property. 
    
4. If Step 1, 2, or 3 fails, look for the property in the root folder. To do that, use **IMsgStore::OpenEntry**, specifying NULL for **lpEntryID**, to open the root folder of the message store and obtain a reference to the **IMAPIFolder** object. 
    
5. If opening the root folder is successful, then use the returned reference to the **IMAPIFolder** object and **IMAPIProp::GetProps** to obtain the desired property.
