## Remarks

This property is a binary value that uniquely identifies a row in a table view. It is a required column in most tables. If a row is included in two views, there are two different instance keys. The instance key of a row may differ each time the table is opened, but remains constant while the table is open. Rows added while a table is in use do not reuse an instance key that was previously used. 
  
Use the **PR_ENTRYID** ( [PidTagEntryId](pidtagentryid-canonical-property.md)) or **PR_RECORD_KEY** ( [PidTagRecordKey](pidtagrecordkey-canonical-property.md)) properties to correlate all the rows of an expansion. Use **PR_INSTANCE_KEY** to locate a particular instance within the expansion. 
  
When a multivalued property is expanded in a table, a row is created for each instance of the expansion, that is, for each value of that property. Each row has a unique value for the **PR_INSTANCE_KEY** property, while all the other columns retain their original values throughout the expansion. 
  
In a categorized sort of a table, rows not corresponding to actual data can be added to the result of the sort. Each such row, like all rows in all tables, has its own unique instance key. 
  
 **PR_INSTANCE_KEY** is also used in table event notifications. The **propIndex** and **propPrior** members of the [TABLE_NOTIFICATION](table_notification.md) structure are [SPropValue](spropvalue.md) structures holding **PR_INSTANCE_KEY** values. The **propIndex** member indicates the row that was added or changed. The **propPrior** member indicates the row before the added or changed row ( **PR_NULL** indicates a change to the first row). 
  
This value is not copied as part of the display table. 
  
 **PR_INSTANCE_KEY** is a [MAPIUID](mapiuid.md) structure. All instance keys can be directly compared as binary values.
