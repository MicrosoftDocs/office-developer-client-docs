# IXPLogon::Poll

  
  
**Applies to**: Outlook 
  
Indicates whether the transport provider has received one or more inbound messages.
  
```
HRESULT Poll(
  ULONG FAR * lpulIncoming
);
```

## Parameters

 _lpulIncoming_
  
> [out] A value that indicates the existence of inbound messages. A nonzero value indicates that there are inbound messages.
    
## Return value

S_OK 
  
> The call succeeded and has returned the expected value or values.
    
## Remarks

The MAPI spooler periodically calls the **IXPLogon::Poll** method if the transport provider indicates it must be polled for new messages, which the provider does by passing the LOGON_SP_POLL flag to the call to the [IXPProvider::TransportLogon](ixpprovider-transportlogon.md) method at the beginning of a session. If the transport provider indicates in response to the **Poll** call that there are one or more inbound messages available for it to process, the MAPI spooler calls the [IXPLogon::StartMessage](ixplogon-startmessage.md) method to allow the provider to process the first inbound message. The transport provider indicates inbound messages by setting the value in the  _lpulIncoming_ parameter to a nonzero value.
