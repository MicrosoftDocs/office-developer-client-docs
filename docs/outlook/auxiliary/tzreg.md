# TZREG

Defines when daylight saving time starts, when the return to standard time occurs, and how many hours the daylight saving shift is.
  
## Quick info

```
typedef struct RenTimeZone { 
    long        lBias;  
    long        lStandardBias; 
    long        lDaylightBias; 
    SYSTEMTIME  stStandardDate; 
    SYSTEMTIME  stDaylightDate; 
} TZREG; 

```

## Members

 _lBias_
  
> The offset from Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).
    
 _lStandardBias_
  
> The offset from bias during standard time.
    
 _lDaylightBias_
  
> The offset from bias during daylight saving time.
    
 _stStandardDate_
  
> The time to switch to standard time.
    
 _stDaylightDate_
  
> The time to switch to daylight saving time.
    
## Remarks

This structure is similar to **TIME_ZONE_INFORMATION**. This is the structure used by legacy clients to store time zone information for recurring meetings.
