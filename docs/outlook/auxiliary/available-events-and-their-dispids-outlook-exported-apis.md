# Available events and their dispids (Outlook exported APIs)

This section describes the dispatch identifiers for the events that Outlook makes available.
  
Outlook exposes the following dispatch identifiers (dispids) to allow C++ add-ins to listen to and handle the corresponding events from the [IDispatch::Invoke](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/automat.idispatch_invoke%28Office.15%29.aspx) function. 
  
|**Constant**|**Dispid for event**|**Description**|**Parameters**|**Remarks**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|**dispidBeforePrint** <br/> |0xFC8E  <br/> |Used to handle the application-level event from the **IDispatch::Invoke** function that fires before a printing operation.  <br/> | There are 2 unnamed parameters:  <br/>  The first parameter is of the type **VT_BOOL|VT_BREF**. Return **VARIANT_TRUE** in this parameter to cancel the event.  <br/>  The second parameter is not used and should be ignored.  <br/> |This dispid is available since Outlook 2010.  <br/> |
|**dispidEventReadComplete** <br/> |0xFC8F  <br/> |Used to handle the item-level event from the **IDispatch::Invoke** function that fires when Outlook has completed reading the properties of the item.  <br/> |There is only one parameter  _Cancel_ which is of the type **VT_BOOL|VT_BREF**. Return **VARIANT_TRUE** in this parameter to cancel the read operation.  <br/> |This dispid is available since Outlook 2010.  <br/> This event corresponds to the Exchange Client Extensions (ECE) event **IExchExtMessageEvents::OnReadComplete**, and also to the **ReadComplete** event that has been added to the object model since Outlook 2013.  <br/> |
   
For an example of how to use a dispid to listen to and handle an event, see the  `CAppEventListener::Invoke` function in the C++ Outlook solution described in [Implementing Outlook 2002/XP Event Sinks in MFC C++ 2003 .NET](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/4230/Implementing-Outlook-2002-XP-Event-Sinks-in-MFC-C).
