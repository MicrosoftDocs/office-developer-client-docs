## Remarks

 **PROP_MAPI_IDENTITY_ENTRYID** is not expected to exist on every account. For example, an Exchange account could have **PROP_MAPI_IDENTITY_ENTRYID** set and not [PROP_ACCT_USER_EMAIL_ADDR](prop_acct_user_email_addr.md), while for an SMTP/POP3 account the situation is reversed. **PROP_MAPI_IDENTITY_ENTRYID** returns an entry ID that is similar to the value returned by  _lppEntryID_ in [IMAPISession::QueryIdentity](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/a2cdda90-5457-49a7-b98c-7273ffe5cbbc%28Office.15%29.aspx).
