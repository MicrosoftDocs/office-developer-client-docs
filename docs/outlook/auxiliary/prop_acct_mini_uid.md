|Identifier:  <br/> |0x0003  <br/> |
|Property type:  <br/> |PT_LONG  <br/> |
|Property tag:  <br/> |0x00030003  <br/> |
|Access:  <br/> |Read-only  <br/> |
   
## Remarks

Get this property by using [IOlkAccount::GetProp](iolkaccount-getprop.md). If the client attempts to set this property, this property returns **E_OLK_PROP_READ_ONLY**. 
  
This property is different from [PROP_ACCT_ID](prop_acct_id.md) in that its value uniquely identifies the account within and outside of the profile in which the account was created, whereas **PROP_ACCT_ID** is unique only among all the accounts within that one profile in which the account was created. When a message with these properties roams onto a second computer with a different Outlook profile and different set of accounts, **PROP_ACCT_MINI_UID** can uniquely identify the original account in the original profile. However, **PROP_ACCT_ID** can possibly conflict with an account in the profile of the second computer.
