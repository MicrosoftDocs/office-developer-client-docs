# About anti-spam settings

Outlook allows users to specify settings for each account to help protect the account from spam. Such anti-spam settings are stored in a section designated for that account in the user's profile. Use the [PROP_ACCT_PREFERENCES_UID](prop_acct_preferences_uid.md) property to obtain the unique ID (UID) for the section in the profile that stores the user's preferences for this account, including the anti-spam settings. 
  
Use the following properties to obtain anti-spam settings for the account:
  
- [PidTagSpamJunkSenders](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/3c5182a7-7d7a-48e8-b9cb-5abd7739f0fd%28Office.15%29.aspx)—Specifies a semicolon-delimited list of email addresses and domains that the user has specified as blocked senders for the account.
    
- [PidTagSpamThreshold](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/2b2d6b8e-e3dd-4a9b-8bb5-53add675605d%28Office.15%29.aspx)—Specifies the level of spam-filtering that the user has specified for the account. The following table shows the supported values.
