# OneNote developer reference

This reference contains conceptual overviews and programmatic references to guide you in developing solutions for OneNote 2013 desktop client applications. It includes all the additions and changes to the OneNote 2013 application programming interface (API), and provides code samples in C# to show how to perform some tasks in OneNote. The OneNote 2013 API enables users to programmatically access and edit OneNote content. Users can also make changes to the view of OneNote windows.

- [Window interfaces](window-interfaces-onenote.md): Describes the **Window** and **Windows** interfaces, which enable users to enumerate through the set of OneNote windows and modify certain window properties. 
    
- [Quick Filing dialog box interfaces](quick-filing-dialog-box-interfaces-onenote.md): Describes the interfaces that you can use to programmatically customize the **Quick Filing** dialog box in OneNote 2013.
